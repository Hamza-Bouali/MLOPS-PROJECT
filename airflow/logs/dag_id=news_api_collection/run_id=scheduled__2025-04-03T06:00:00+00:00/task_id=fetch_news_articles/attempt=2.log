That’s down from 7.0% in 2021, 6.5% in 2022, and 3.5% in 2023.\n\nBut on Amazon, traditionally known as the marketplace where you can get cheap items conveniently, inflation persists.\n\nIn fact, the average price of goods sold by third-party (3P) sellers on Amazon rose by 6.7% from December 2023 to December 2024 according to SmartScout’s Amazon Inflation Tracker.\n\nThird Party SellersSmartScout\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis is significant because these 3P sellers represent 2/3rds of the top 10M ASINs.\n\nScott Needham, Founder and CEO of SmartScout, notes that rising Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) fees which Amazon levies on 3P sellers are at the heart of the price increases.\n\n\n “When Amazon launched its 3P seller marketplace in 2000, FBA fees were intentionally low to attract more sellers. But they’ve ballooned over the last 25 years, increasing by 96% for standard size products. I’ve been selling on Amazon for over a dozen years, and I can tell you that the pace and severity of these fees has only been accelerating in recent years” said Needham.\n\n## How Rising Fees Have Translated into Rising Prices on Amazon\n\n2024 was a watershed year with the introduction of two new FBA fees from Amazon:\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\n### Trump Imposes Tariffs On Uninhabited Heard And McDonald Islands—‘Remotest Places On Earth’\n\n### NYT Mini Today: Hints, Clues And Answers For Thursday, April 3\n\n### 4 Republicans Break With Trump As Senate Rejects His Canada Tariffs\n\n1. Inbound Placement Service Fee: Effective March 1, 2024, this fee charges sellers for the distribution of inventory to multiple fulfillment centers. Sellers can choose:\u200b\n\n- Minimal Shipment Splits: Ship to a single location; Amazon distributes inventory, incurring fees from $0.21 to $0.68 per unit for standard-size items and $2.16 to $6.00 for large bulky items.\n- Partial or Amazon-Optimized Shipment Splits: Ship to multiple locations; reduced or no fees apply.\n\n2. Low-Inventory-Level Fee: Starting April 1, 2024, this fee applies to standard-size products with inventory levels consistently below 28 days of supply, based on historical demand. It's designed to encourage sellers to maintain adequate stock levels to meet customer demand.\n\n“These fees represent a major shift in Amazon's fulfillment strategy, transferring more logistical responsibilities and costs to sellers,” said Needham. “Most sellers have come to rely on Amazon’s world-class fulfillment network, so when forced to choose between re-engineering their entire supply chain versus paying an increased fee, most sellers opted to pay the fee and pass that along to their customers.”\n\nHow many decided to raise prices due to increased FBA fees? Nearly 65%.\n\nThat’s according to SmartScout’s recently released “Voice of the Amazon Seller Report.”\n\nVoice of the Seller ReportSmartScout\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n“What’s wild is how little impact raising prices seems to have had for sellers,” said Needham. “While 65% of sellers said they had raised prices due to FBA fees, nearly 60% of those sellers still said they were less profitable year over year. Sellers are barely keeping up, and that’s before you add on the added headache of tariffs.”\n\n## Amazon Shoppers’ Perception of Inflation\n\nAs prices on Amazon continue to outpace general CPI, I wanted to look at how that maps against consumer sentiment.\n\nAccording to a recent Prosper Insights &amp; Analytics survey, when looking across nine different product categories, Amazon Prime members were more likely than the average U.S. adult to notice price increases in every single category.\n\nNow, the delta is only around 1% for each category, but the universality is interesting. Amazon Prime members are more likely to notice price increases across the board.\n\nProsper - Price IncreasesProsper Insights &amp; Analytics\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe numbers get more striking when you ask about significantly higher prices.\n\n39.5% of Amazon Prime members noticed significantly higher prices versus a year ago for household essentials items. That’s 170 basis points higher than U.S. adults more broadly.\n\nHow is that impacting consumer behavior, if at all?\n\nWell, on one hand, we’re seeing fewer people shop online as a way to combat price increases.\n\nAccording to a recent Prosper Insights &amp; Analytics survey, the percentage of U.S. adults who were shopping online as a result of price increases peaked at 24.3% in December of 2023. Today, that number has dropped to 20.9%, a 340 basis point drop.\n\nMeanwhile, Prime members have always been significantly more likely to shop online, so we see a huge delta between them and the average U.S. adult. The percentage of Prime members who were shopping online as a result of price increases peaked at 29.4% in February of 2022. Today, that number is at 24.7%, a 470 basis point drop.\n\nProsper - As a Result of Price Increases Are You Doing Any of the FollowingProsper Insights &amp; Analytics\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhat does it all mean?\n\nEven though Prime members are more likely to shop online for deals, inflation is catching up to them, and it’s doing so at a faster rate than it is to U.S. adults in general.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn a year where national inflation cooled, Amazon told a different story.\n\nThird-party sellers, burdened by rising FBA fees and newly implemented costs like the Inbound Placement Service Fee and the Low-Inventory-Level Fee, had few options but to raise prices.\n\nThis financial strain has not gone unnoticed by shoppers. Amazon Prime members are reporting a higher awareness of inflation than the average U.S. adult. While online shopping once served as a hedge against inflation, the percentage of consumers doing so has fallen markedly since 2023, even more sharply among Prime members.\n\nThat’s translating into sales.\n\nWe saw retail sales decline by -0.9% month over month (MoM) in January of 2025, the largest decrease in two years. But non-store retailers (eCommerce) saw an even larger decrease MoM at -1.9%.\n\nAdd it all up, and Amazon’s central role in U.S. eCommerce means these shifts are rippling outward.\n\n“Amazon’s flywheel has always been built on lower prices, better customer experience, more traffic, and expanded selection via a greater variety of sellers,” said Needham. “It’s a virtuous cycle. But I worry about that flywheel’s longevity when two of its foundational components – prices and sellers – start getting squeezed. In an uncertain retail environment, one thing is likely true: the brands that can communicate value will be the ones that win.”\n\n© 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

However, the total amount stolen by the operation is unknown as it also involves the hard-to-trace Monero cryptocurrency.\n\nKaspersky isn\'t sure how the devices are infected with Triada but hypothesizes it\'s the result of a supply chain attack.\n\n"Its [Triada\'s] new version is embedded into smartphone firmware before the devices even reach users," commented\xa0Kaspersky\'s Dmitry Kalinin.\n\n"It is likely that the supply chain is compromised at some point, so even the stores may not realize they\'re selling phones with Triada."\n\nTo mitigate this risk, only buy smartphones from authorized distributors.\n\nWhen in doubt, reflash your device using a clean system\xa0image from Google, or a trustworthy third-party ROM like LineageOS or GrapheneOS.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Top 10 MITRE ATT&amp;CK© Techniques Behind 93% of Attacks\n\nBased on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&amp;CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\n\n### Related Articles:\n\nNew Crocodilus malware steals Android users’ crypto wallet keys\n\nNew Android malware uses Microsoft’s .NET MAUI to evade detection\n\nMalicious Android \'Vapor\' apps on Google Play installed 60 million times\n\nBadBox malware disrupted on 500K infected Android devices\n\nVo1d malware botnet grows to 1.6 million Android TVs worldwide\n\n- Android\n- Firmware\n- Malware\n- Smartphone\n- Triada\n\n##### Bill Toulas\n\nBill Toulas is a tech writer and infosec news reporter with over a decade of experience working on various online publications, covering open-source, Linux, malware, data breach incidents, and hacks.\n\n- Previous Article\n- Next Article\n\n##### Post a Comment Community Rules\n\n###### You need to login in order to post a comment\n\nNot a member yet?

Toys sold in slimmed-down boxes or no packaging at all. More household goods that shoppers need to assemble themselves.\n\nThese are some of the ways consumer product companies are retooling their wares to reduce costs and avoid raising prices\xa0as President Donald Trump levies\xa0new import taxes on key trading partners as well as some materials used by American manufacturers.\n\nThe economic environment in which the president has imposed, threatened and occasionally postponed repeated rounds of tariffs is more precarious than during his first term.\n\nSteve Rad, CEO of toy maker Abacus Brands Inc., which designs science kits and other educational toys for older children, shows a black mold plastic material packaging insert that will be replaced with an improved cardboard material to help offset the costs of future trade tariffs in El Segundo, Calif., on Monday, March 31, 2025. AP\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nU.S. consumers are\xa0feeling tapped out\xa0after several years of inflation. Businesses say tariffs\xa0add to their expenses\xa0and eat into their profits, but they are wary of losing sales if they try to pass all of the increase on to customers.\n\nInstead, some companies are exploring cost-cutting options, both ones that consumers likely would notice in time — remember\xa0“shrinkflation?”\xa0— and ones that exist too far down the supply chain for them to see. The changes may help minimize price increases yet won’t be enough in every case to offset them completely.\n\nThese are some of the strategies retailers and brands have in mind:\n\n## Explore More\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### High school football star fatally stabbed in the heart, left to die in twin brother's arms at track meet: dad\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### Woman who wrongfully accused stranger of rape and kidnapping learns fate\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### Mayor Adams drops out of Dem primary in bombshell shakeup after 'bogus' corruption case dismissed — but he has another plan\n\n#### A kink in the supply chain:\n\nAfter putting an extra 20% tariff on all goods from China, as well as a 25% tariff on imported steel, aluminum and\xa0automobiles, Trump said he would announce on Wednesday the targets of\xa0“reciprocal tariffs”\xa0that mirror the taxes all other nations apply to certain U.S. exports.\n\nHe argues the tariffs will spur domestic manufacturing, among other goals.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump holds an executive order about tariffs increase, flanked by U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., February 13, 2025.  REUTERS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAlso on the horizon: twice-delayed tariffs on most goods\xa0from Canada\xa0and Mexico, and duties on copper,\xa0lumber\xa0and pharmaceutical drugs.\n\nKimberly Kirkendall, president of supply-chain consulting firm International Resource Development, has told clients — U.S. makers of shelving, home goods and food products — that given all the uncertainty, this is not the time for long-term moves like seeking factories outside of China.\n\n## See Also\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### What is Trump’s tariff ‘Liberation Day’ and could it spark a global trade war?\n\nShe encouraged them to focus on the short term, particularly the need to scrutinize product lines from every angle for possible savings.\n\n“You’ve got to collaborate and work together with your suppliers in this situation to be able to bring costs down,” Kirkendall said.\n\nSourcing concerns are not only a worry for big companies that rely on Chinese manufacturers. Sasha Iglehart, founder of a small online clothing company called Shirt Story, has a collection of upcycled men’s shirts that sell for around $235. She said she typically gets her vintage buttons from an Austrian supplier and knows Trump has talked about taxing goods from the European Union.\n\n“I will continue to look for local vendors and collectors here in the States as back up,” said Iglehart, whose company is based in Connecticut.\n\n#### Reworking a product\n\nFor many companies, evaluating which components or details they can remove from their products or replace with less expensive ones is the go-to move for absorbing the potential financial hit from tariffs.\n\nLos Angeles-based toy company Abacus Brands Inc., which designs science kits and other educational toys, has most of its products made in China. By using slightly thinner paper in an 80-page project book that comes with two of its kits, the company expects to avert a $10 retail price increase, President Steve Rad said.\n\n“Three or 4 cents here,” Rad said. “Seven or 6 cents there. Two more pennies over there. All of a sudden, you’ve made up the difference.”\n\nA cargo ship full of shipping containers is seen at the port of Oakland as trade tensions escalate over U.S. tariffs, in Oakland, California, U.S., February 3, 2025.  REUTERS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAurora World Inc., known for its plush pets and toy vehicles, is looking at using fewer paint colors as a way to counteract tariff costs, according to Gabe Higa, managing director of the California company’s toy division. All of Aurora World’s toys come from factories in China.\n\n“This is something that makes it a little bit simpler so that there’s less manual labor involved or less material cost,” Higa said. “(It) doesn’t have a lot of incremental value so it’s easy to take away.”\n\nThe company still may have to raise prices as long as the new tariffs are in effect, he said.\n\n## See Also\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### Trump poised to unveil more tariffs on ‘Liberation Day’ — here’s what to expect\n\n#### Economy packaging:\n\nTweaking or reducing\xa0product packaging\xa0is another area where importers may cut back and carries the advantage of possibly appealing to\xa0eco-conscious customers.\n\nBasic Fun CEO Jay Foreman, whose company markets classic toys like Tonka trucks, Lincoln Logs and Care Bears, said he is presenting retailers with three different packaging options and asking them to decide which ones they prefer for the trucks and some other products that will be in stores next spring.\n\nThe first is the current packaging, which consists of a box with a big open window that lets customers see what’s inside. The second option: no box, just a tray attached to the bottom of toys to hold them in place on shelves. The third: unwrapped but affixed with a simple paper price tag that features brand information.\n\nThe second-tier packaging would reduce the toy company’s cost per item by $1.25, and the package-free version would yield savings of $1.75, Foreman said. Both would diminish the appeal of the products and would not come close to canceling out the tariff on goods made in China, Foreman said.\n\nHe said he would make pricing decisions later this week after Trump provides details about his planned reciprocal tariffs.\n\nSteve Rad, CEO of toy maker Abacus Brands Inc., shows a newly improved matte box, left, that will replace its black plastic mold packaging insert, seen right, with an improved cardboard material to help offset the costs of future tariffs in El Segundo, Calif., on Monday, March 31, 2025. AP\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo further reduce its production costs, Abacus Brands is thinking of switching from plastic to cardboard for the package inserts that keep toy parts in place. Cardboard trays cost 7 cents per unit compared to 30 cents for the plastic version, according to Rad.\n\nThe change requires finding a new factory to make the inserts, a move that did not make financial sense before now, he said. The various tariff-related modifications should be effective for fall and holiday deliveries to stores, Rad said.\n\n“The compromises we’re making are things that do not matter to the consumer,” he said.\n\n### Charlie Gasparino has his finger on the pulse of where business, politics and finance meet\n\nSign up to receive On The Money by Charlie Gasparino in your inbox every Thursday.\n\n### Thanks for signing up!\n\nPlease provide a valid email address.\n\nBy clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.\n\nNever miss a story.\n\n#### Forget the extras\n\nShoppers will likely have to assemble more of their products at home as companies look to reduce shipping costs, according to Kirkendall of International Resource Development.\n\nOne of her clients manufactures self-watering planters that are made in China.

Chris Bajda, managing partner at online wedding gift retailer Groomsday, said accessories like batteries and decorative gift boxes may end up in the latter category.\n\n“We now carefully assess what’s truly necessary and avoid including items that don’t serve a functional purpose for the customer,” Bajda said.\n\n#### The return of shrinkflation?\n\nReducing the size or weight of products without lowering prices proliferated as a business practice from 2021 through 2024 as companies grappled with rising costs for ingredients, packaging, labor and transportation.\n\nEdgar Dworsky, a consumer advocate and former assistant attorney general in Massachusetts, suspects the makers of consumer goods will embrace shrinkflation again to hide costs given the blast of new tariffs. The additional import tax on Canadian soft lumber, for example, might show up in smaller toilet paper rolls, he said.\n\n“Shrinkflation has been a little quiet” in the last few months, Dworksy said. “But I would expect to see both price increases and product shrinkage.”\n\n- donald trump\n- economy\n- inflation\n- tariffs\n- 4/2/25\n\n#### Trending Now\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tin US News\n\n- This story has been shared 106,207 times.\n106,207\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHigh school football star fatally stabbed in the heart, left to die in twin brother's arms at track meet: dad\n- This story has been shared 36,501 times.\n36,501\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWoman who wrongfully accused stranger of rape and kidnapping learns fate\n- This story has been shared 32,640 times.\n32,640\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMayor Adams drops out of Dem primary in bombshell shakeup after 'bogus' corruption case dismissed — but he has another plan\n- This story has been shared 30,319 times.\n30,319\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInside Elon Musk's departure from DOGE — and the real reason behind why he's leaving\n\n#### Most Commented\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJoin the conversation\n\n- This story has 3.1K comments.\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3.1K\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tElon Musk reveals DOGE's new target — members of Congress who\xa0got 'strangely wealthy'\n- This story has 2K comments.\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2K\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTrump's bizarro-world tariffs will turn economy upside down\n- This story has 1.7K comments.\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1.7K\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLuigi Mangione should face death penalty for 'cold-blooded assassination' of insurance CEO, Pam Bondi orders\n\n## Now on\n Page Six\n\n- Kylie Kelce shares baby name ‘contenders that didn’t make the cut’ after giving birth to 4th daughter Finnley\n- Taylor Swift’s plaid skirt is on sale for a rare 40% off right now\n- Where Melinda Gates stands with ex Bill after ‘grueling’ divorce\n\n#### Video\n\n- Rangers stay alive in tight playoff chase | New York Sports Minute\n\n## Now on\t\t\t\t Decider\n\n- ‘Today’s Jenna Bush Hager Confesses That She Schedules Sex With Her Husband: “I Don’t Love It, But Otherwise It Don’t Happen”\n- Val Kilmer Tribute: A Reluctant Matinee Idol Who Shone Brightest Playing Goofballs\n- Reese Witherspoon’s Lookalike Daughter Ava Phillippe Boards ‘Doctor Odyssey’ For Her Acting Debut: See The Photos\n- Bill Murray Grabs Naomi Watts And Kisses Her On The Mouth In Shocking ‘WWHL’ Moment\n\n## Covers\n\n### Today's Cover\n\n#### Front Cover\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBack Cover\n\n#### Flip for back cover\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### Browse Covers\n\n## \n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## More Stories\n\n### Page Six\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#### Kanye West reveals wife Bianca Censori had panic attack, left him over disturbing rants in new song: 'She ran away'\n\n### NYPost\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#### Miller Gardner's toxicology results confirm his cause of death after Yankee great's son, 14, died on vacation: report\n\n- Facebook\n- Twitter\n- Instagram\n- LinkedIn\n- Email\n- YouTube\n\n- Sections &amp; Features\n    - US News\n    - Metro\n    - World News\n    - Sports\n    - Sports Betting\n    - Business\n    - Opinion\n    - Entertainment\n    - Fashion &amp; Beauty\n    - Shopping\n    - Lifestyle\n    - Real Estate\n    - Media\n    - Tech\n    - Science\n    - Health\n    - Travel\n    - Astrology\n    - Video\n    - Photos\n    - Alexa\n    - Covers\n    - Horoscopes\n    - Sports Odds\n    - Podcasts\n    - Crosswords &amp; Games\n    - Columnists\n    - Classifieds\n- Post Sports+\n    - Subscribe\n    - Articles\n    - Manage\n- Newsletters &amp; Feeds\n    - Email Newsletters\n    - RSS Feeds\n    - NY Post Official Store\n    - Home Delivery\n        - Subscribe\n        - Manage Subscription\n    - Delivery Help\n- Help/Support\n    - About New York Post\n    - Editorial Standards\n    - Customer Service\n    - Apps Help\n    - Community Guidelines\n    - Contact Us\n        - Tips\n        - Newsroom\n        - Letters to the Editor\n        - Licensing &amp; Reprints\n        - Careers\n        - Vulnerability Disclosure Program\n- Apps\n    - iPhone App\n    - iPad App\n    - Android Phone\n    - Android Tablet\n    - Advertise\n        - Media Kit\n        - Contact\n\n<!-- image -->"}, {'source': {'id': None, 'name': 'Securityaffairs.com'}, 'author': 'Pierluigi Paganini', 'title': 'U.S. CISA adds Apache Tomcat flaw to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog', 'description': 'U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) adds Apache Tomcat flaw to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog.

The vulnerability affects multiple versions including 11.0.0-M1 to 11.0.2, 10.1.0-M1 to 10.1.34, and 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.98. Exploitation requires write-enabled default servlet, partial PUT support, and specific file handling conditions.\n\n“The original implementation of partial PUT used a temporary file based on the user provided file name and path with the path separator replaced by “.”.”\xa0reads the advisory.\n\n“If all of the following were true, a malicious user was able to view security sensitive files and/or inject content into those files:\n\n- writes enabled for the default servlet (disabled by default)\n- support for partial PUT (enabled by default)\n- a target URL for security sensitive uploads that is a sub-directory of a target URL for public uploads\n- attacker knowledge of the names of security sensitive files being uploaded\n- the security sensitive files also being uploaded via partial PUT\n\nIf all of the following were true, a malicious user was able to perform remote code execution:\n\n- writes enabled for the default servlet (disabled by default)\n- support for partial PUT (enabled by default)\n- application was using Tomcat’s file based session persistence with the default storage location\n- application included a library that may be leveraged in a deserialization attack”\n\nTomcat versions 9.0.99, 10.1.35, and 11.0\xa0addressed\xa0the vulnerability.\n\nWallarm researchers confirmed active exploitation of the flaw and added that attackers can hijack Apache Tomcat servers with a single PUT API request. PoC is online.\n\n“A devastating new remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability,\xa0CVE-2025-24813, is now actively exploited in the wild. ” reads the\xa0advisory\xa0published by Wallarm. “Attackers need just one PUT API request to take over vulnerable Apache Tomcat servers. The exploit, originally published by a Chinese forum user iSee857, is already available online: CVE-2025-24813 PoC by iSee857.”\n\nThe attack exploits Tomcat’s session persistence and partial PUT requests by uploading a malicious Java session file and triggering deserialization via a GET request.\n\nThe attack involves two steps:\n\n1. Uploading a Malicious Serialized Session\xa0– The attacker sends a PUT request containing a base64-encoded ysoserial gadget chain, storing it in Tomcat’s session directory.\n2. Triggering Execution via Session Cookie\xa0– A GET request with the JSESSIONID referencing the malicious session forces Tomcat to deserialize and execute the payload, granting remote access.\n\n“This attack is dead simple to execute and requires no authentication. The only requirement is that Tomcat is using file-based session storage, which is common in many deployments.” concludes the advisory. “Worse, base64 encoding allows the exploit to bypass most traditional security filters, making detection challenging.”\n\nWallarm researchers warn that most Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) fail to detect this attack because the PUT request appears normal and lacks obvious malicious content. The payload is base64-encoded, evading pattern-based detection, and the attack occurs in two steps, with execution happening only during deserialization. Additionally, most WAFs do not thoroughly inspect uploaded files or track multi-step exploits. As a result, by the time organizations notice the breach in their logs, it is already too late.\n\nUsers are recommended to update their affected Tomcat versions immediately to mitigate potential threats.\n\nAccording to\xa0Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities, FCEB agencies have to address the identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect their networks against attacks exploiting the flaws in the catalog.\n\nExperts also recommend private organizations review the\xa0Catalog\xa0and address the vulnerabilities in their infrastructure.\n\nCISA orders federal agencies to fix this vulnerability by\xa0April 22, 2025.\n\nFollow me on Twitter:\xa0@securityaffairs\xa0and\xa0Facebook\xa0and\xa0Mastodon\n\nPierluigi\xa0Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs\xa0–\xa0hacking, CISA)\n\n#### you might also like\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n##### New Triada Trojan comes preinstalled on Android devices\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n##### New advanced FIN7\'s Anubis backdoor allows to gain full system control on Windows\n\n#### leave a comment\n\n#### newsletter\n\n###### Subscribe to my email list and stay\n up-to-date!\n\n#### recent articles\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n###### New Triada Trojan comes preinstalled on Android devices\n\nMalware / April 03, 2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n###### New advanced FIN7\'s Anubis backdoor allows to gain full system control on Windows\n\nMalware / April 02, 2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n###### U.S. CISA adds Apache Tomcat flaw to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog\n\nSecurity / April 02, 2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n###### Apple backported fixes for three actively exploited flaws to older devices\n\nSecurity / April 02, 2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n###### Spike in Palo Alto Networks scanner activity suggests imminent cyber threats\n\nHacking / April 02, 2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo contact me write an email to:\n\n\n                            Pierluigi Paganini : \n\n[email\xa0protected]\n\n#### QUICK LINKS\n\n- Home\n- Cyber Crime\n- Cyber warfare\n- APT\n- Data Breach\n- Deep Web\n- Digital ID\n- Hacking\n- Hacktivism\n- Intelligence\n- Internet of Things\n- Laws and regulations\n- Malware\n- Mobile\n- Reports\n- Security\n- Social Networks\n- Terrorism\n- ICS-SCADA\n- POLICIES\n- Contact me\n\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2024\n\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Notably, the UMF 15+ segment recorded an impressive CAGR of nearly 11.2% in 2024 alone, significantly outpacing lower UMF variants like UMF 5+ and UMF 10+. This accelerated growth can be attributed to rising consumer awareness of the correlation between higher UMF ratings and enhanced antibacterial and therapeutic efficacy. A 2024 consumer survey by Nielsen indicated that 63% of premium honey buyers specifically cited UMF certification and antibacterial potency as primary purchase motivators, underscoring the precise market positioning that UMF 15+ occupies.\n\nMoreover, UMF 15+ honey\'s rapid expansion in the manuka honey market is driven by strong demand in high-growth regional markets, particularly the Asia-Pacific region and Europe. For instance, in China, premium Manuka honey imports surged by approximately 18% year-on-year in 2023, with UMF 15+ honey accounting for nearly 45% of the premium segment\'s total sales. Similarly, in Europe, especially Germany and the UK, sales of higher-grade Manuka honey rose by approximately 14% in 2024, driven by health-conscious consumers increasingly utilizing UMF 15+ honey for medicinal purposes such as digestive health improvement, immune boosting, and wound care. Furthermore, a recent market report highlighted that UMF 15+ honey commands an average price premium of 30-40% over lower-grade Manuka honeys, reflecting consumers\' willingness to pay more for authenticated, high-potency products. These targeted consumer preferences, combined with strategic marketing campaigns emphasizing scientific validation and health efficacy, continue to position UMF 15+ as the leading growth driver within the premium honey category.\n\nOnline Sales of Manuka Honey is Strengthening\n\nThe online distribution channel has rapidly surged as a dominant force for Manuka honey market sales globally, driven by shifting consumer behaviors, robust digital marketing strategies, and enhanced logistics. According to a 2025 consumer insights report by Astute Analytica, approximately 64% of global Manuka honey consumers now prefer purchasing online due to convenience, wider product variety, and transparent access to product certifications such as UMF ratings. This trend is particularly pronounced among health-conscious millennial and Gen Z consumers, with 78% of these younger demographics citing detailed product information and verified customer reviews as key motivators for choosing online platforms over traditional retail. Additionally, direct-to-consumer (D2C) Manuka honey brands experienced a notable 22% rise in online sales in 2024, highlighting consumers\' growing trust in buying premium, health-focused products directly from brand-operated digital storefronts.\n\nStrategically, digital marketing initiatives emphasizing product authenticity, origin transparency, and health benefits further amplify online channel growth in the Manuka Honey. A 2024 Google Consumer Behavior Report indicated a 35% year-over-year increase in global searches for "authenticated UMF Manuka honey online," demonstrating digital consumer engagement driven in the manuka honey market by targeted SEO and influencer campaigns. Moreover, marketplaces such as Amazon and Alibaba have significantly accelerated Manuka honey’s global online penetration, with Alibaba reporting a 28% year-on-year increase in premium Manuka honey transactions during the 2024 Singles\' Day sales event alone. Enhanced logistics infrastructure, including improved cold-chain management and traceability technologies, has also facilitated seamless international delivery, with cross-border online Manuka honey shipments rising by approximately 19.5% globally in 2024. These targeted digital strategies, combined with consumer demand for verified premium health products, position online channels as the critical distribution frontier driving Manuka honey’s global market expansion.\n\nSkincare and Cosmetics Surge is Reshaping the Regional Demand and Consumption Dynamics of the Manuka Honey Market\n\nNorth America: The U.S. and Canada lead consumption, driven by health-conscious millennials and baby boomers. In 2025, 60% of Manuka honey is consumed as a dietary supplement (e.g., spoonfuls for immunity), while 25% is used in food and beverage products like snack bars and teas in the United States.

Per capita consumption averages 0.05 kg annually, with urban centers like Los Angeles and Toronto showing higher uptake.\n\nEurope: Europe’s consumption in the manuka honey is dominated by the UK, Germany, and France, where Manuka honey is prized for its medicinal properties. In 2025, 50% of volume is used in pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals (e.g., throat lozenges), 30% in food and beverages, and 20% in cosmetics. The region imports 1,050 metric tons annually, with a preference for UMF 10+ and higher grades. Per capita consumption is 0.03 kg, with growth fueled by rising disposable incomes and organic product trends.\n\nAsia-Pacific: This region exhibits the largest Manuka honey market market share and is witnessing the fastest consumption growth. Wherein, New Zealand is the major exporter and China consuming 400 metric tons in 2024, followed by Japan and India. In China, 70% of Manuka honey is consumed as a luxury health tonic, often gifted during festivals. Japan favors it for elderly care (40% of use), while India’s younger demographic integrates it into smoothies and skincare (50% combined). Per capita consumption ranges from 0.01 kg (India) to 0.04 kg (Japan), with e-commerce driving accessibility.\n\nRest of the World: Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa account for smaller shares, with total consumption at 350 metric tons. Brazil and South Africa lead, using Manuka honey in gourmet foods and traditional medicine. Per capita consumption is minimal (0.005 kg), constrained by cost and availability.\n\nNew Zealand is the Powerhouse of Manuka Honey Market\n\nNew Zealand has long dominated global Manuka honey production due to its distinctive geographical and regulatory advantages. The country’s approximately 11,795 tons of annual honey exports represent nearly half of its total production, translating to over $333 million in export value, with Manuka honey comprising the majority. Notably, New Zealand’s average export price stands at $22.61 per kilogram, substantially higher than the typical global average of $3.33, underscoring the premium nature of its product. A robust market share of 10% by value in global honey exports illustrates how the nation, despite ranking only 17th in export volume, secures the second-highest export value globally. This premium status is also reflected in the $53.13 per kilogram that monofloral Manuka honey commanded in 2020–2021. Primary export destinations include the United States, China, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Australia, demonstrating New Zealand’s broad international reach and the strong demand for its high-quality honey.\n\nIn 2024, the country honey market reached an estimated $446.7 million, supported by a 53% increase in registered hives over the preceding five-year period. A noteworthy 100% mandatory testing regime ensures that exported Manuka honey meets stringent standards such as MGO, DHA, and leptosperin content, verified by an extensive network of MPI-recognized laboratories. In addition, robust traceability through HACCP principles supports consumer confidence, with 64% of global customers specifically preferring verified New Zealand–sourced products. New Zealand’s supply chain infrastructure features multiple extraction and processing plants, promoting a high level of coordination among beekeepers—many of whom operate at a small scale within a fragmented industry structure. Manuka honey from New Zealand typically fetches a 30-40% price premium over lower-grade varieties, reflecting its well-established reputation.\n\nCustomize this report to your needs: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/ask-for-customization/manuka-honey-market\n\nPricing Dynamics of the Manuka Honey Market\n\nThe Manuka honey market demonstrates robust growth trajectories. This growth is primarily driven by increasing consumer awareness of health benefits and the rising demand for natural sweeteners, particularly in pharmaceutical and food &amp; beverage industries. The market\'s pricing structure reveals significant stratification based on UMF grades, with entry-level UMF 5+ products starting at $20/kg and premium UMF 20+ varieties commanding up to $200/kg. The industry has witnessed a 10% price increase since 2023, primarily due to supply constraints and the limited 2-6 week annual flowering period. \xa0Recent corporate performance metrics indicate some market volatility, with industry leader Comvita reporting a net loss of NZ$3.2 million in H1 2023-2024, attributed to a 12% revenue decline in key markets like China and the United States.\n\nThe regulatory landscape across major manuka honey markets continues to evolve, with the EU implementing the Omnibus package that has raised reporting thresholds for non-EU companies to €450 million in net turnover, up from €150 million.

More than 70% of firms leverage AI solutions such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) for sentiment analysis, exemplified by Genpact’s Cora platform that cuts average handling time (AHT) from 8 minutes to 6.4 minutes per call—a 20% efficiency gain. Robotic Process Automation (RPA) now powers 40-50% of repetitive tasks: one Noida-based BPO deploys 200 bots, each processing 1,000 transactions daily, collectively saving 500 human hours per month.\n\nMarket-leading tools like UiPath, Automation Anywhere, and Blue Prism are used extensively, while Salesforce, Zendesk, and SAP SuccessFactors anchor CRM and HR outsourcing operations. Meanwhile, cloud adoption continues its sharp climb, with AWS and Microsoft Azure hosting 80% of workloads—a 15% rise in spending. BPO heavyweights TCS and Infosys champion hyperautomation (AI, RPA, and analytics combined), reducing telecom billing cycles from 48 hours to 12 hours. Furthermore, 30% of Indian BPOs have embraced augmented reality (AR) for remote tech support, enabling real-time visual guidance that trims resolution times by 25%. This convergence of smart technologies positions India as a futuristic outsourcing hub, offering unprecedented efficiency and accuracy.\n\nWorkforce Metrics and Micro-Trends\n\nIndia’s business process outsourcing (BPO) services market workforce, now 1.6 million strong, embodies youthful dynamism with a 60% male and 40% female representation, and an average age of 28—up from 25 in 2015, thanks in part to improved retention. Tier-2 cities like Indore attract younger employees (average age 24) at salaries of INR 15,000-20,000 per month. Overall attrition levels break down as 30% for voice-based processes, 15% for non-voice, and 10% for KPO. However, some firms, such as Concentrix, have successfully lowered attrition to 18% by introducing ESOPs and providing Python/Tableau upskilling.\n\nOn the broader development front, 60% of the workforce undergoes 20-40 hours of annual training through programs like Nasscom’s FutureSkills Prime, which trained 150,000 professionals in AI and cloud between 2023 and 2024. Gig workers now comprise 5-7% of BPO manpower, surging by 25% during festive e-commerce spikes on platforms like Upwork. An especially novel shift sees 10% of agents moonlighting as micro-influencers, boosting client social media engagement by 15% and blending customer support with marketing.\n\nRegional Hubs and Operational Nuances\n\nIndia’s business process outsourcing (BPO) services market footprint spans major metros and emerging Tier-2 cities, creating a versatile blend of cost efficiency and talent availability. Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Pune account for 45% of the total seats, with Bengaluru alone hosting 200,000+ agents. Hyderabad's HITEC City dazzles with more than 50 large campuses of 5,000 seats each, particularly strong in IT and analytics. Tier-2 hubs such as Coimbatore (30,000 seats), Jaipur (25,000 seats), and Chandigarh (20,000 seats) bring costs down by 20%, where, for example, Jaipur’s rentals sit at INR 20-30/sq.ft. in stark contrast to INR 80-100/sq.ft. in Bengaluru.\n\nRural BPOs in Bihar and Odisha also see steady growth. A Patna center staffed by 800 employees—90% of them women—operates at a monthly wage of INR 10,000, far lower than INR 25,000 in Delhi. Most sites boast 100 Mbps+ internet and solar backups, reflecting growing infrastructural maturity. A fascinating addition to the mix is the rise of coastal hubs like Mangaluru, now managing 60% of Asia’s maritime logistics tasks, capitalizing on local seafaring expertise. Such regional diversity consolidates India’s reputation as a global outsourcing titan.\n\nCost Structures and Financial Insights\n\nCost competitiveness remains a key lure for businesses in business process outsourcing (BPO) services market, with per-seat costs in metros at INR 15,000-20,000/month and INR 8,000-12,000 in Tier-2 cities. Revenue per seat spans from INR 40,000 in voice processes to INR 80,000 in KPO, typically yielding 50-60% margins. Billing rates also impress: US$ 12-15/hour for voice, US$ 18-22/hour for non-voice, and US$ 25-35/hour for KPO tasks. For instance, a 500-seat BPO in Gurugram taking in US$ 20/hour could reach US$ 1.5 million monthly revenue at a 40% profit margin.\n\nCapital expenditure priorities are shifting—down 30% on physical assets but up 40% on tech, translating to about US$ 500-1,000/seat yearly. Meanwhile, many large BPOs introduce “pay-per-outcome” billing models tied directly to sales or conversions, increasing client ROI by 18%. These financial strategies underscore India’s position as a profit powerhouse, particularly appealing to companies seeking a “cost-effective BPO” in 2024.\n\nClient-Specific Innovations\n\nIndian business process outsourcing (BPO) services market continue to customize services for major industry verticals. In US BFSI, they now process 70% of mortgage applications, with AI trimming verification times by 50% (e.g., 10,000 monthly applications at Wells Fargo). E-commerce giants such as Amazon and Flipkart handle over 1 million seasonal interactions through Indian BPOs, managed 60% by chatbots and 40% by live agents. Healthcare BPO has soared by 20% in medical coding, with Omega Healthcare processing 500,000 HIPAA-compliant records monthly.\n\nIntriguingly, gaming firms like EA outsource 80% of their in-game support to India, where agents handle around 10,000 tickets daily, frequently utilizing VR simulations for faster issue resolution. These bespoke innovations firmly establish India’s leadership in delivering niche and high-tech offerings.\n\nGovernment and Regulatory Boost Reshaping the India BPO Services Market\n\nSupportive government initiatives amplify India’s business process outsourcing (BPO) services market potential in 2024. The IBPS scheme commits INR 500 crore to create 120,000 jobs across over 100 smaller cities, illustrated by a Madurai-based center with 800 agents earning INR 80 lakh in government subsidies. Additionally, PLI (Production-Linked Incentive) programs reduce IT hardware import costs by 10-15%, helping BPO operators cut overheads.\n\nComing fully into force in 2023, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act brings India in line with global privacy standards, strengthening client trust. Moreover, the government has extended tax holidays for AI-driven BPO services until 2026, increasing tech investment by 25%. Together, these moves fortify India’s regulatory environment, reassuring companies determined to find “reliable BPO regulations” in 2024.\n\nMicro-Trends and Competitive Edge\n\nA series of micro-trends in 2024 is supercharging India’s edge in the global business process outsourcing (BPO) services market landscape. Voice-to-text transcription now covers 25% of calls, surfacing 50,000 monthly leads that yield US$ 200,000 in upsells. Multilingual demand—spanning Spanish, French, and Mandarin—jumps by 30%; in Kochi alone, 200 French-speaking agents cater to European clients. Niche KPO services like legal outsourcing have expanded by 18%, with providers such as QuisLex billing US$ 40/hour for top US law firms. Even blockchain-based contract management has entered the picture, with 15% of BPOs adopting it to reduce fraud by 30% for BFSI clients. These creative pivots maintain India’s stature as the destination for “innovative BPO trends” in 2024.\n\nCustomize this report to your needs: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/ask-for-customization/india-business-process-outsourcing-bpo-Services-market\n\nChallenges Mitigated\n\nIndia’s business process outsourcing (BPO) services market has been proactive in facing and conquering challenges. Cybersecurity now absorbs 8-10% of revenue (around US$ 2 million annually for a 5,000-seat operation), but breaches drop by 40% thanks to robust measures. Attrition, historically 20-25%, is lowered using gamification incentives: Gurugram-based BPOs offer INR 5,000 monthly bonuses to high performers, saving up to INR 10 crore yearly in turnover costs. AI-based analytics predict agent burnout, enabling timely breaks and cutting employee churn by 12%.\n\nCollectively, these initiatives bolster stability and help assure potential clients searching for “stable BPO services” in 2024. As demonstrated throughout each segment—from financial viability to cutting-edge technology—India’s BPO landscape seamlessly merges cost savings, innovation, and a well-trained workforce, confirming its place at the forefront of global outsourcing.\n\nIndia Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) Services Market Key Players:\n\n- Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)\n- Genpact Ltd.\n- Infosys Ltd.\n- Wipro BPM\n- HCLTech (HCL BPO Services)\n- Teleperformance India\n- Accenture\n- Concentrix India\n- WNS\n- Other Prominent Players\n\nKey Segmentation:\n\nBy Service Type\n\n- Front-Office Services (Customer Interaction Services)\n    - Customer Support/Call Centers\n    - Technical Support Services\n    - Sales &amp; Marketing Support\n    - Help Desk Services\n- Back-Office Services\n    - Data Entry and Processing\n    - Payment Processing\n    - HR Management (Payroll, Recruitment,       Training)\n    - Accounting and Bookkeeping\n    - Supply Chain Management\n- Knowledge-Based Services (KPO - Knowledge Process Outsourcing)\n    - Legal Process Outsourcing (LPO)\n    - Market Research and Data Analytics\n    - Medical Transcription and Coding\n    - Intellectual Property Research\n    - Financial and Risk Analysis\n\nBy Sourcing Type\n\n- Onsite Outsourcing\n- Offsite Outsourcing\n- Nearshore Outsourcing\n\nBy Enterprise Size\n\n- Small &amp; Medium Enterprises\n- Large Enterprises\n\nBy End User\n\n- Healthcare\n- Retail and eCommerce\n- Media and Entertainment\n- Insurance\n- Telecommunication\n- IT Services\n- Telemarketing\n- Consulting\n- Others\n\nInquire about this report before purchasing: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/inquire-before-purchase/india-business-process-outsourcing-bpo-Services-market\n\nAbout Astute Analytica\n\nAstute Analytica is a global market research and advisory firm providing data-driven insights across industries such as technology, healthcare, chemicals, semiconductors, FMCG, and more.

It also offers streaming and online retail options. But as the company looks to broaden its audience and turn around its business, it\'s shifting its focus to social media.\n\nWhile live shopping on social media, namely TikTok, has exploded in China, it\'s been slow to take off in the U.S. And the partnership comes as TikTok\'s future in the U.S. is uncertain.\n\nStill, the partnership announced Wednesday builds on QVC\'s earlier team up with TikTok. It also gives TikTok Shop its first constant, live stream of shoppable content. QVC products have been available through the TikTok Shop since August, nearly a year after the app introduced the live, shoppable experience to its users in the U.S.\n\nSince launching on the TikTok Shop, the company said more than 74,000 TikTok creators have featured QVC products on their shoppable videos and livestreams. Wednesday\'s announcement is sure to expand that, said David Rawlinson II, president and CEO of QVC Group Inc.\n\n"Everybody\'s been talking about this being the next big thing in retail for five or 10 years but it never quite has hit," Rawlinson said. "I think this is the start of it really hitting. And that\'s the TikTok bet. That\'s our bet."\n\nQVC on TikTok.\n\nCourtesy: QVC Group Inc.\n\n## Business revamp\n\nQVC Group — which is part of QVC Group Inc. and controlled by media mogul John Malone — is aiming to do more than bring its longstanding business of constant live shopping from TV to social media.\n\nThe deal comes as the company recently concluded a turnaround plan, known as Project Athens, after what Rawlinson referred to as a "perfect storm" of issues.\n\nAt the height of the pandemic, QVC\'s businesses saw a surge in sales and viewership, like many retailers and media companies. But the drop-off was steep as stay-at-home orders lifted and consumers started spending on live events and travel rather than retail.\n\nQVC\'s problems were then amplified. More consumers cut the cord and fled the pay TV bundle, weighing on the company\'s TV networks. The retail industry also had to contend with supply chain issues and heightened competition in online shopping from the rise of Temu and others.\n\nThings worsened for the company in December 2021, months after Rawlinson took the helm of QVC Group Inc. A deadly fire ripped through the company\'s North Carolina fulfillment center. QVC lost a half a billion dollars in inventory, Rawlinson said.\n\n"I sort of felt like I was hired to transform the company, but because of this perfect storm of events, the first job turned out to be saving the company," Rawlinson said.\n\nThrough a series of cost-cutting measures, QVC saw its profitability improve and its debt load ease. Still, the transformation is far from complete. Rawlinson noted during a February investor call that QVC has yet to "achieve stable revenue," and that will be its main focus moving forward.\n\nThe drop-off in TV viewership has been pronounced. When comparing 2024 to 2018, QVC\'s and HSN\'s main channels reached 44% and 47% fewer homes, respectively, Rawlinson said on February\'s call.\n\nLast week, the company said it would lay off about 900 employees and consolidate its operations in its West Chester, Pennsylvania, headquarters.\n\nThe partnership with TikTok comes days after the company released its annual report to shareholders, which noted its focus on social media and efforts to shift the business.\n\n"As traditional TV declines and a mix of video platforms takes a greater share of customer attention, we must hurry our expansion beyond TV to find growth. Our strategy is to transform QVC Group into a live social shopping company," QVC Group Inc. wrote in a letter to shareholders in March.\n\nIn the letter, QVC said it would "intensify" its efforts in social media and streaming to notch $1.5 billion in run-rate revenue from these platforms in the next three years.\n\n"Social is just the natural evolution of what we\'ve always done," Rawlinson said.\n\nQVC\'s audience and shoppers typically skew female and over 50. Last year, CNBC reported that the company signed a deal to add USA Pickleball to its platforms to capitalize on that audience and find new avenues to transform its business.\n\n## Ticking clock\n\nTikTok has officially launched its e-commerce service TikTok Shop in the US.\n\nCostfoto | Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\nTikTok has seen explosive growth in the U.S., and the company said it has 170 million users. But its fate in the country remains unclear.\n\nThe Chinese-owned social media app is once again staring down at a deadline that could see it effectively banned on April 5, stemming from a national security law originally signed by former President Joe Biden that requires parent company ByteDance to divest its American operations.\n\nThe original deadline was Jan. 19, but President Donald Trump signed an executive order that granted ByteDance 75 more days to divest the U.S. portion of its business.\n\nAlthough the future remains uncertain, creators appear to be cautiously optimistic this time around that TikTok will remain in the U.S., CNBC reported Tuesday. Trump has since said he may reduce tariffs on China in order to help move forward a deal in which ByteDance exits U.S. operations.\n\nEven with the possibility of a ban in the U.S., Rawlinson said moving forward with the partnership on TikTok Shop was the best bet for QVC\'s business.\n\n"TikTok has a very widely penetrated user base in the U.S. We know a lot of our customers, and our future customers, are there, and we know that shopping is developing and growing very quickly in really interesting ways there," Rawlinson said.\n\n"So we felt like that\'s the right way to try to change how shopping is done in the U.S. That\'s the full calculus for us. We didn\'t try to guess the future of TikTok," he added.\n\n— CNBC\'s Jonathan Vanian contributed to this article.\n\n## Don’t miss these insights from CNBC PRO\n\n- Goldman slashes S&amp;P 500 2025 forecast for second time this month to lowest on Street\n- These are Wall Street analysts’ favorite Dow stocks heading into the second quarter\n- Wall Street analysts say Elon Musk is the clear auto tariff winner: \'Tesla wins, Detroit bleeds\'\n- This internet stock is the best-performing name in Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio this year, up 21%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Subscribe to CNBC PRO\n- Subscribe to Investing Club\n- Licensing &amp; Reprints\n- CNBC Councils\n- Supply Chain Values\n- CNBC on Peacock\n- Join the CNBC Panel\n- Digital Products\n- News Releases\n- Closed Captioning\n- Corrections\n- About CNBC\n- Internships\n- Site Map\n- Ad Choices\n- Careers\n- Help\n- Contact\n\n- News TipsGot a confidential news tip?

Ireland and Europe need to act collectively and develop a coherent strategy to remove these tariffs through negotiation," he said in a statement.\n\n“If negotiations are unsuccessful, we must respond to this unprovoked hostility and stand in solidarity with our European partners and friends.\n\xa0 \xa0\n“As a trade union movement, we are very concerned about the impact on jobs and investment. We are also concerned about Ireland\'s fiscal position and the knock-on risks for the state\'s capacity deal with the challenge of a growing and aging population and building the public services required.\n\n“It is crucial that we introduce appropriate schemes, such as an adequate short-time work scheme, to protect jobs, workers’ incomes and skills in vulnerable but viable business. The new Pay-Related Jobseekers’ Benefit is welcome, but will not be enough to protect certain groups of workers in certain sectors and local economies.\n\n“Government need to set up several sectoral industry taskforces with union and employer representation along with industry expertise and the relevant state agencies not only to manage this disruption but also to build a more sustainable future for these industries.\n\n“Now is the time to once and for all diversify and reorientate our economic model to a new one, built on good jobs, a productive economy, economic security and economic stability. We can no longer have our economy disproportionately exposed to the actions of any one country or sector.\n\n“We look forward to engaging with government through the LEEF process on all of this tomorrow morning.”\n\nRyan Nugent\n\n## UK government draws up potential list of products to retaliate against Trump tariffs\n\nThe UK government has drawn up a list of products that could be slapped with import taxes in retaliation against US President Donald Trump’s tariffs on British goods.\nUK business secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the UK government had drawn up an “indicative list of potential products that the Government considers most appropriate for inclusion” in any tariffs against US exports.\nThe list includes key US products such as Bourbon whiskey, motorcycles, guitars and jeans but also includes scores of other items ranging from whale meat to chopsticks.\nThe US president unveiled tariffs on countries around the world on Wednesday night, with the UK’s 10% rate putting it in the lowest “baseline” category, but the UK PM Keir Starmer acknowledged British exporters would be hurt by the levy.\n\nAmy Blaney\n\n\'This has a distance to go yet, there will be negotiations\' says Micheal Martin.\n\nRyan Nugent\n\n## \'Premature\' to discuss EU fund for companies hit by tariffs - McGrath\n\nEU Commissioner Michael McGrath has said it is "premature" to be discussing a potential EU fund to support companies impacted by the tariffs.\n\n"Our focus for now is on preventing the harm, rather than responding to the harm, because we\'re still in a scenario where we\'re looking at potential," he said.\n\nRyan Nugent\n\n## \'Recessionary trends\'\n\nTaoiseach Micheál Martin has said he is concerned about the “recessionary trends” that could come as investment is hit after Donald Trump’s tariff announcement.\n\n“The real problem is, though, is the imposition of tariffs on such a wide scale and at a high level across the world will have a dampening effect on investment, and that in itself, could create recessionary trends across the world,” the Taoiseach said at a press conference.\n\n“I\'m worried more about the global impact of this and the impact on investments, the pausing of investments, investors generally keep the head below the parapet until this settles down, and that is a problem. Sentiment matters. Psychology matters,” he added.\n\nRyan Nugent\n\n## Ireland will weather the storm - Martin\n\nAmy Blaney\n\n## Too early to consider supporting businesses hit by tariffs, says Micheal Martin\n\nThe Taoiseach said it is still too early to consider supporting businesses hit by President Donald Trump\'s import tariffs of 20pc but that he expected talks with the US on the impact of the levies.\n\n"It\'s somewhat early yet to be talking in terms of supports (for businesses)," Martin told a press conference.\xa0\n\n"I think this is not the end of the story... I anticipate negotiations, I believe there will be negotiations."\n\nAmy Blaney\n\nMr Martin said: "From our perspective, the figures don\'t reflect the reality of the situation as we see it. I think it was inevitable that some figures were going to be produced last evening to justify the imposition of tariffs.\xa0\n\n"The more fundamental point for us is, one, tariffs are bad, as the Commissioner said, they hurt people. There are attacks on people. Basically there are attacks on businesses, and they can disrupt economic activity. That\'s the fundamental point. And two, we need to have a sensible negotiation between the US and the European Union to get this to a safer and more sensible settlement, that that would mean we could that businesses could adjust and could navigate.\n\n"Thirdly, we within Europe and within Ireland, need now to focus also on enhancing our competitiveness in other markets. Encourage enterprise Island companies to break into new markets, negotiate new trade deals between Europe and other big economic actors like India and Indonesia.

Ireland and Europe need to act collectively and develop a coherent strategy to remove these tariffs through negotiation," he said in a statement.\n\n“If negotiations are unsuccessful, we must respond to this unprovoked hostility and stand in solidarity with our European partners and friends.\n\xa0 \xa0\n“As a trade union movement, we are very concerned about the impact on jobs and investment. We are also concerned about Ireland\'s fiscal position and the knock-on risks for the state\'s capacity deal with the challenge of a growing and aging population and building the public services required.\n\n“It is crucial that we introduce appropriate schemes, such as an adequate short-time work scheme, to protect jobs, workers’ incomes and skills in vulnerable but viable business. The new Pay-Related Jobseekers’ Benefit is welcome, but will not be enough to protect certain groups of workers in certain sectors and local economies.\n\n“Government need to set up several sectoral industry taskforces with union and employer representation along with industry expertise and the relevant state agencies not only to manage this disruption but also to build a more sustainable future for these industries.\n\n“Now is the time to once and for all diversify and reorientate our economic model to a new one, built on good jobs, a productive economy, economic security and economic stability. We can no longer have our economy disproportionately exposed to the actions of any one country or sector.\n\n“We look forward to engaging with government through the LEEF process on all of this tomorrow morning.”\n\nRyan Nugent\n\n## UK government draws up potential list of products to retaliate against Trump tariffs\n\nThe UK government has drawn up a list of products that could be slapped with import taxes in retaliation against US President Donald Trump’s tariffs on British goods.\nUK business secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the UK government had drawn up an “indicative list of potential products that the Government considers most appropriate for inclusion” in any tariffs against US exports.\nThe list includes key US products such as Bourbon whiskey, motorcycles, guitars and jeans but also includes scores of other items ranging from whale meat to chopsticks.\nThe US president unveiled tariffs on countries around the world on Wednesday night, with the UK’s 10% rate putting it in the lowest “baseline” category, but the UK PM Keir Starmer acknowledged British exporters would be hurt by the levy.\n\nAmy Blaney\n\n\'This has a distance to go yet, there will be negotiations\' says Micheal Martin.\n\nRyan Nugent\n\n## \'Premature\' to discuss EU fund for companies hit by tariffs - McGrath\n\nEU Commissioner Michael McGrath has said it is "premature" to be discussing a potential EU fund to support companies impacted by the tariffs.\n\n"Our focus for now is on preventing the harm, rather than responding to the harm, because we\'re still in a scenario where we\'re looking at potential," he said.\n\nRyan Nugent\n\n## \'Recessionary trends\'\n\nTaoiseach Micheál Martin has said he is concerned about the “recessionary trends” that could come as investment is hit after Donald Trump’s tariff announcement.\n\n“The real problem is, though, is the imposition of tariffs on such a wide scale and at a high level across the world will have a dampening effect on investment, and that in itself, could create recessionary trends across the world,” the Taoiseach said at a press conference.\n\n“I\'m worried more about the global impact of this and the impact on investments, the pausing of investments, investors generally keep the head below the parapet until this settles down, and that is a problem. Sentiment matters. Psychology matters,” he added.\n\nRyan Nugent\n\n## Ireland will weather the storm - Martin\n\nAmy Blaney\n\n## Too early to consider supporting businesses hit by tariffs, says Micheal Martin\n\nThe Taoiseach said it is still too early to consider supporting businesses hit by President Donald Trump\'s import tariffs of 20pc but that he expected talks with the US on the impact of the levies.\n\n"It\'s somewhat early yet to be talking in terms of supports (for businesses)," Martin told a press conference.\xa0\n\n"I think this is not the end of the story... I anticipate negotiations, I believe there will be negotiations."\n\nAmy Blaney\n\nMr Martin said: "From our perspective, the figures don\'t reflect the reality of the situation as we see it. I think it was inevitable that some figures were going to be produced last evening to justify the imposition of tariffs.\xa0\n\n"The more fundamental point for us is, one, tariffs are bad, as the Commissioner said, they hurt people. There are attacks on people. Basically there are attacks on businesses, and they can disrupt economic activity. That\'s the fundamental point. And two, we need to have a sensible negotiation between the US and the European Union to get this to a safer and more sensible settlement, that that would mean we could that businesses could adjust and could navigate.\n\n"Thirdly, we within Europe and within Ireland, need now to focus also on enhancing our competitiveness in other markets. Encourage enterprise Island companies to break into new markets, negotiate new trade deals between Europe and other big economic actors like India and Indonesia. That\'s that\'s the key, and negotiations will work through the figures."\n\nAmy Blaney\n\n## Pharmaceuticals\n\nOn the subject of pharmaceuticals, Mr Martin said: "The key objective over the last while has been to convey the complexity of the pharmaceutical story.\xa0\n\n"Ireland is part of a complex, integrated supply chain.

The math doesn’t add up—especially when most brands can only realistically manage relationships with an average of 6 retail media networks, according to research from Skai and the Path to Purchase Institute.\n\nAmazon\'s head start in retail media explains part of this imbalance, but there\'s a deeper issue at play: the advertiser experience itself. Brands face a fragmented ecosystem with inconsistent interfaces, workflows, and reporting methodologies across retailers. The result is an increasingly unsustainable environment where smaller networks struggle to compete despite offering valuable, unique audiences.\n\nPart of the solution to these fundamental challenges may lie in a technology that transformed digital advertising over a decade ago but has been slow to take hold in retail media: Real-Time Bidding (RTB).\n\n## Why RTB Matters For Retail Media\n\nReal-Time Bidding represents the backbone of programmatic advertising, allowing for the automated buying and selling of ad impressions in milliseconds. When you visit a news website and see display ads appear almost instantly, you\'re witnessing RTB in action—an entire auction has occurred in the background during page load.\n\nFor retail media, RTB offers transformative potential by addressing three big industry pain points:\n\n1. Fragmentation and Scale: With the proliferation of retail media networks, brands face the impossible task of managing direct relationships with dozens of platforms, each with unique interfaces, metrics, and workflows. RTB creates standardization across networks, allowing advertisers to execute campaigns across multiple retailers through a single platform.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\n### Trump Imposes Tariffs On Uninhabited Heard And McDonald Islands—‘Remotest Places On Earth’\n\n### NYT Mini Today: Hints, Clues And Answers For Thursday, April 3\n\n### 4 Republicans Break With Trump As Senate Rejects His Canada Tariffs\n\n2. Measurement and Transparency: One of advertisers\' biggest frustrations with retail media is inconsistent measurement across platforms. Standardized RTB protocols would enable unified reporting and attribution models.\n\n3. Democratization of Inventory: RTB opens retail media inventory to a broader range of advertisers, increasing competition and potentially improving yield for retailers while providing more options for brands to be seen in the right place at the right time.\n\n## RTB Has Already Transformed Two Other Advertising Ecosystems\n\nThere’s historical precedent for RTB in earlier “eras” of advertising.\n\nReal-Time Bidding (RTB) originally brought standardization to the display advertising landscape by enabling multiple advertisers and publishers to transact across a unified, real-time marketplace, as opposed to making all media buys manually and separately.\n\nThis common protocol, called OpenRTB, was first introduced in 2010 was initially spearheaded by a few ad tech companies and then taken up by the IAB. As of 2023, over 90% of U.S. digital display ad dollars run programmatically, largely powered by RTB.\n\nThe same idea worked for connected TV more recently, where updated standards ("OpenRTB 2.6") let streaming apps and advertisers easily buy and sell video ad spots using the same principles.\n\n## The Technical Challenge of RTB in Retail Media\n\nThe slow adoption of RTB in retail media isn\'t for lack of interest—it\'s because retail environments present unique technical challenges.\n\nWhile RTB is standard in display advertising, retail media has two major hurdles:\n\n1. Latency: Traditional RTB involves communicating with external platforms in real time for each ad request, potentially adding 100+ milliseconds to page load times. In retail, where user experience is directly tied to revenue, this latency can significantly impact conversion rates.\n\n2. Relevance: Unlike content sites where ads can be only tangentially related to surrounding content, retail environments demand highly relevant product ads that match user intent. The algorithm must deliver this relevance in milliseconds.\n\nThese challenges help explain why retail media has largely relied on direct deals and pre-cached bids rather than true real-time auctions. However, advances in technology are beginning to overcome these barriers.\n\nThe value chain of retail media buying with an RTB framework.Kiri Masters | Retail Media Breakfast Club\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The Next Wave: OpenRTB for Retail Media\n\nThe Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) and its IAB Tech Lab have been working to adapt OpenRTB specifications specifically for retail media’s unique requirements. Jeffrey Bustos, a former vice president at the IAB, highlighted this effort in his op-ed for the Path To Purchase Institute, "Democratizing Retail Media Through OpenRTB." Bustos explained how the standard protocol is being tailored to balance the technical demands of programmatic buying with the relevance requirements of retail environments.\n\n"To adapt openRTB for retail, we are fine-tuning our technical specifications to account for retail-specific nuances such as the relevancy of ads to the consumer\'s interests and the retailer\'s product offerings," explained Hillary Slattery, senior director of programmatic product at IAB Tech Lab.\n\nThese improvements make it easier for retailers to share product information in a standard format while still keeping control over how ads appear on their websites. Simply put, retailers can join the programmatic ecosystem without sacrificing their unique shopping experiences.\n\n## Major Platforms Like Microsoft Lead The RTB Charge\n\nMajor advertising platforms recognize the opportunity in standardizing retail media buying. Microsoft, for example, is positioning itself as an aggregation point across retail media networks.\n\n"We’ve really been thinking about how we become an aggregation point across various networks of high-quality retail media supply and then really make it easy to activate a product campaign that runs across those networks in a standardized way," says Lynne Kjolso, VP, Global Partner &amp; Retail Media at Microsoft. "We very much believe that the best way to deliver that kind of advertiser value is going to be in a real-time environment."\n\nMicrosoft aims to extend its existing advertiser relationships—approximately 500,000 advertisers already using their platforms—to retail media supply, enabling a single product campaign to extend across multiple retail environments through RTB technology.\n\nThis presents a compelling proposition for retailers: access to a massive new pool of advertisers without the overhead of building direct relationships. For brands, it promises simplified campaign management across multiple retail properties.\n\nGoogle’s advertising ecosystem is pursuing similar goals, though with different strategic emphasis points. Both technology giants recognize that the future of retail media lies in standardization and scale, which are two benefits that RTB delivers.\n\n## What’s Holding Retailers Back From RTB?\n\nDespite the clear benefits, many retailers remain hesitant to fully embrace RTB. Their concerns generally fall into four categories:\n\n1. Control and Brand Safety: Retailers value tight control over the shopping experience and are wary of letting third-party demand-side platforms directly bid into their on-site inventory. They may fear inappropriate products or messaging could damage customer trust.\n\n2. Premium Inventory and Margins: In retail media, sponsored product placements represent premium inventory with high CPMs or CPCs. Some retailers worry RTB could introduce price competition that reduces average revenue per impression.\n\n3. Data Protection: Retailers\' first-party data—purchase history, loyalty information, browsing behavior—is arguably their most valuable asset. Sharing this data programmatically in real time raises both privacy and strategic concerns.\n\n4. Technical Complexity: Setting up a real-time bidding environment requires significant technical infrastructure—ad server integrations, consent management, fraud detection, and more. Many retailers lack the in-house expertise to implement these systems at scale.\n\n## Looking Ahead To A Real-Time Era\n\nThe evolution of RTB in retail media likely mirrors what we\'ve seen in other advertising sectors. When comparing retail media\'s current state to the progression of RTB in connected TV (CTV), we see striking parallels.\n\nCTV initially faced similar challenges with format standardization, audience fragmentation, and technical implementation barriers. Yet the industry evolved rapidly, with standardization initiatives like OpenRTB 2.6 specifically addressing streaming media’s unique needs.\n\nFor retail media, the path forward will likely include:\n\n1. Standardization Through IAB Leadership: The IAB\'s work on adapting OpenRTB for retail media will create the foundation for wider adoption, reducing technical barriers for retailers.\n\n2. Hybrid Models During Transition: Retailers can begin with hybrid approaches—maintaining direct relationships with top-tier brands while opening secondary inventory to RTB. This balances control with incremental revenue opportunities.\n\n3. Retail Media-Specific RTB Solutions: Specialized technology providers focused solely on the retail media space will emerge with solutions that address the unique challenges of product listing ads and sponsored search within retail environments.\n\n4. Increased Pressure From Advertisers: As brands recognize the efficiency and measurement benefits of standardized RTB across retail media networks, they\'ll increasingly demand this capability from their retail partners.\n\n## The Business Case For Retailers\n\nFor retailers hesitant about embracing RTB, there’s a compelling business case beyond just technical evolution. Microsoft’s Kjolso says that retailers are protective of their first-party data and their inventory, “and I think we need to honor that.” But she adds that the pressures of really intense competition across a very crowded marketplace of RMNs, and the pressure to increasing ‘fill rates’ (the amount of dedicated ad space on on a retailer website that is successfully sold to advertisers) will lead retailers to adopt RTB technology in order to tap into more demand sources like Microsoft, Google, The Trade Desk, and other DSPs.\n\n“Once you’ve launched a retail media program and become a new profit source in the retailer, it’s great,” she says. "But then you have to deliver. You have to deliver ongoing growth. How are they going to do that without taking a step towards evolution?"\n\nThis evolution is perhaps most critical for mid-tier retail media networks. While category leaders like Amazon and Walmart can sustain direct relationships with thousands of brands, smaller networks face an existential challenge: how to compete for advertiser budgets when brands can only manage relationships with six networks at most.\n\n## What This Means For Brands\n\nFor brands, the implications are equally significant. The current fragmented landscape forces marketers to:\n\n1. Manage dozens of separate retail media platforms, each with unique interfaces and workflows\n2. Reconcile inconsistent measurement methodologies across retailers\n3. Make difficult choices about which retail media networks deserve direct investment\n\nRTB promises to alleviate these challenges by bringing retail media buying closer to the efficiency and standardization brands experience in other digital channels. A brand could potentially manage campaigns across numerous retailers through familiar demand-side platforms, with standardized measurement and optimization capabilities.\n\n## Conclusion: Preparing For The Inevitable\n\nThe question is not whether RTB will become standard in retail media, but when and how. The progression we’ve seen in display advertising and connected TV shows that initial resistance gives way to pragmatic adoption as the business benefits become clear.\n\nFor retailers, now is the time to begin planning for this evolution, by assessing current tech infrastructure for RTB readiness. For brands, the opportunity is to advocate for this change with retail partners while preparing internal teams for a more programmatic approach to retail media buying.\n\nThe retail media landscape is maturing rapidly, and RTB represents the next logical step in its evolution. Those who embrace this change early will help shape the standards and practices that define the industry\'s future—and likely gain competitive advantage in the process.\n\n© 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Ireland and Europe need to act collectively and develop a coherent strategy to remove these tariffs through negotiation," he said in a statement.\n\n“If negotiations are unsuccessful, we must respond to this unprovoked hostility and stand in solidarity with our European partners and friends.\n\xa0 \xa0\n“As a trade union movement, we are very concerned about the impact on jobs and investment.

Ireland and Europe need to act collectively and develop a coherent strategy to remove these tariffs through negotiation," he said in a statement.\n\n“If negotiations are unsuccessful, we must respond to this unprovoked hostility and stand in solidarity with our European partners and friends.\n\xa0 \xa0\n“As a trade union movement, we are very concerned about the impact on jobs and investment. We are also concerned about Ireland\'s fiscal position and the knock-on risks for the state\'s capacity deal with the challenge of a growing and aging population and building the public services required.\n\n“It is crucial that we introduce appropriate schemes, such as an adequate short-time work scheme, to protect jobs, workers’ incomes and skills in vulnerable but viable business. The new Pay-Related Jobseekers’ Benefit is welcome, but will not be enough to protect certain groups of workers in certain sectors and local economies.\n\n“Government need to set up several sectoral industry taskforces with union and employer representation along with industry expertise and the relevant state agencies not only to manage this disruption but also to build a more sustainable future for these industries.\n\n“Now is the time to once and for all diversify and reorientate our economic model to a new one, built on good jobs, a productive economy, economic security and economic stability. We can no longer have our economy disproportionately exposed to the actions of any one country or sector.\n\n“We look forward to engaging with government through the LEEF process on all of this tomorrow morning.”\n\nRyan Nugent\n\n## UK government draws up potential list of products to retaliate against Trump tariffs\n\nThe UK government has drawn up a list of products that could be slapped with import taxes in retaliation against US President Donald Trump’s tariffs on British goods.\nUK business secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the UK government had drawn up an “indicative list of potential products that the Government considers most appropriate for inclusion” in any tariffs against US exports.\nThe list includes key US products such as Bourbon whiskey, motorcycles, guitars and jeans but also includes scores of other items ranging from whale meat to chopsticks.\nThe US president unveiled tariffs on countries around the world on Wednesday night, with the UK’s 10% rate putting it in the lowest “baseline” category, but the UK PM Keir Starmer acknowledged British exporters would be hurt by the levy.\n\nAmy Blaney\n\n\'This has a distance to go yet, there will be negotiations\' says Micheal Martin.\n\nRyan Nugent\n\n## \'Premature\' to discuss EU fund for companies hit by tariffs - McGrath\n\nEU Commissioner Michael McGrath has said it is "premature" to be discussing a potential EU fund to support companies impacted by the tariffs.\n\n"Our focus for now is on preventing the harm, rather than responding to the harm, because we\'re still in a scenario where we\'re looking at potential," he said.\n\nRyan Nugent\n\n## \'Recessionary trends\'\n\nTaoiseach Micheál Martin has said he is concerned about the “recessionary trends” that could come as investment is hit after Donald Trump’s tariff announcement.\n\n“The real problem is, though, is the imposition of tariffs on such a wide scale and at a high level across the world will have a dampening effect on investment, and that in itself, could create recessionary trends across the world,” the Taoiseach said at a press conference.\n\n“I\'m worried more about the global impact of this and the impact on investments, the pausing of investments, investors generally keep the head below the parapet until this settles down, and that is a problem. Sentiment matters. Psychology matters,” he added.\n\nRyan Nugent\n\n## Ireland will weather the storm - Martin\n\nAmy Blaney\n\n## Too early to consider supporting businesses hit by tariffs, says Micheal Martin\n\nThe Taoiseach said it is still too early to consider supporting businesses hit by President Donald Trump\'s import tariffs of 20pc but that he expected talks with the US on the impact of the levies.\n\n"It\'s somewhat early yet to be talking in terms of supports (for businesses)," Martin told a press conference.\xa0\n\n"I think this is not the end of the story... I anticipate negotiations, I believe there will be negotiations."\n\nAmy Blaney\n\nMr Martin said: "From our perspective, the figures don\'t reflect the reality of the situation as we see it.

Less than half of all countries count a billionaire among their citizens. A fifth of those that do have just one.\n\nThis year, 78 nations and semi-autonomous territories have at least one billionaire on the list, the same number as last year. The richest member of any country is Tesla cofounder and CEO Elon Musk (estimated net worth: $342 billion), who was born a dual citizen of South Africa and Canada but obtained American citizenship in 2002 and has counted the United States as his primary residence ever since. Among mainland China’s 450 billionaires, the richest is Zhang Yiming ($65.5 billion), cofounder of TikTok parent ByteDance. India’s wealthiest is Mukesh Ambani ($92.5 billion), who chairs Reliance Industries, the multinational conglomerate founded by his late father.\n\nThe U.S. dominates the top of the ranking, with only two non-Americans in the “$100 Billion Club.” One is Amancio Ortega ($124 billion), the richest person in Spain and cofounder of the retailer Inditex, known for the Zara fast fashion brand. The other is Bernard Arnault ($178 billion), the wealthiest in France, whose fashion and cosmetics empire LVMH includes the likes of Louis Vuitton and Sephora.\n\nThree countries have joined or rejoined since last year: Albania and Peru, which have one billionaire each, and Saudi Arabia, where Forbes identified 14 new billionaires and one returnee. The Saudi fortunes stem from a wide range of sources, from banking to pharmaceuticals to broadcasting. The richest is that of investor Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Alsaud ($16.5 billion). Peru’s richest person, Eduardo Hochschild ($2.4 billion), returns to the list this year thanks to the rising share price of his mining company, while Albania has its first-ever billionaire: Samir Mane ($1.4 billion), who created the country’s largest supermarket and retail electronics chains.\n\nMeanwhile, Bangladesh, Panama and Uruguay no longer have any billionaires. Muhammed Aziz Khan ($1.1 billion), who chairs the Bangladeshi energy company Summit Group, has been living in Singapore and finally transferred his citizenship there (the city-state doesn’t allow dual citizenship). He’s not the wealthiest of his new nationality, though—that title belongs to the paint manufacturing entrepreneur Goh Cheng Liang ($13 billion). Meanwhile, Forbes has recategorized the assets of Panama’s Stanley Motta as a family fortune in light of new information, so the banking investor is no longer considered an individual billionaire. And Uruguay’s Andrés Bzurovski Bay and Sergio Fogel have fallen below the three-comma mark thanks to the dropping share price of their fintech startup dLocal.\n\nThe Asia-Pacific region had the most billionaire citizens in 2024, but this year its 1,052 ranking members put it just behind the Americas, which have 1,077, led by 902 in the U.S. After that comes Europe (772) and the Middle East &amp; Africa (127).\n\n## Here is the richest billionaire of each country and semi-autonomous region on the 2025 World’s Billionaires list.\n\n#### DATA AS OF MARCH 7, 2025.\n\n### Albania\n\n## Richest Person: Samir Mane\n\n#### Age: 57 | Net Worth: $1.4 Billion | Rank: 2356 | Source of Wealth: Diversified\n\n### Algeria\n\n## Richest Person: Issad Rebrab &amp;

Big names such as Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), Gap (GAP), and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch (ANF) have warned about the impact of tariffs this year on profits. In the meantime, shoppers are growing concerned about what they will be paying for spring and summer apparel once tariffs kick in. The reality is that consumers may resist the higher prices, sending retailers off to offer profit-busting discounts and earnings warnings. Luxury goods companies are by no means immune to the challenges as their results have been powered by international shoppers and a wealthy class feasting on strong stock market gains (until now). Is there any reason to be optimistic about the sector? Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi sits down on the Opening Bid podcast with noted fashion designer Rebecca Minkoff for her perspective on the state of retail. Minkoff created her company from the ground floor in the mid-2000s and has seen some of the highest of the highs and lowest of the lows in retail. Minkoff is also the author of the new book Fearless: The New Rules for Unlocking Creativity, Courage, and Success, where she aims to impart leadership wisdom to the next generation of female entrepreneurs.\n\nWelcome to a new episode of Opening Bid. I\'m Yahooy\'s executive editor Brian Sazi. Like I would say, this is the podcast that will make you a better investor and a better leader. I really want to lean into being a better leader here today with our next guest. It is Rebecca Minkoff, uh, fashion designer, entrepreneur, leader, a little bit ofeverything,\n\na little bit of everything, podcaster.\n\nYeah, I\'ve been following your journey for some time. Congrats on this new book, uh, Fearless, the new rules for unlocking creativity, courage and success. What made you write this now?\n\nYou know, I wrote the hardcover in 2021 after we testing my rules during COVID, saying if I have to rebuild my business in the pandemic, let me see if this worked a second time after I started my company.And it was time to release it in paperback, make it more accessible, and we\'re celebrating our 20th anniversary as a brand. It\'s been 20 years, 20 years, so I figured this was perfect timing.\n\nHave you,uh, did yousell the company?\n\nWe sold the company 3 years ago.\n\nYes, that tough to do?\n\nIt was tough only because, you know, it\'s my name. I\'m connected to it, but I\'m there every day. I\'m a very happily paid employee and I, I love, I love the work and I continue to be there no matter what. So take\n\nus inside this book. What are some of the lessons that you\'ve learned.Uh, building your business,\n\nIthink the idea of risk taking, I think so many people are averse to taking risks and the fear that overcomes them, you know, in their gut stops them. And so the goal of this book is that, you know, pulling your hair over your shoulder and saying I\'m fearless. It\'s really about I\'m scared, but here are some things I can hold on to to just take the risk anyways.\n\nWhat did you, uh, you know, as you were or have been building your business, did you make any mistakes along the way?\n\nNone.No, it\'s been so easy. Um, we\'d be here all day. I mean we made risks from early on from not having quality control and having the wrong designers, you know, brand inside my bag so that was, that was a humbling moment we\'ve made risks when it came to using.Tech early on, you know, having a Twitter, a live Twitter feed during my fashion show, not realizing that when you start trending on Twitter as it was called back in the day, that maybe some inappropriate things are shown to 1300 people. So you name it, we\'ve, we\'ve, we\'ve made mistakes. How did you overcome those?You know, thank goodness for that one. That was my brother\'s idea, and I looked him in the eyes. I said, I\'m so glad this is your idea because if it was mine, I\'d, you would never, you know, stop talking about it.\n\nThat\'s one thing I I didn\'t realize your brother. I mean he helped get this business off the ground, right? What is that relationship like? Um, what was it like in theearly days,\n\nI guess? I mean, in the early days it was phone a friend, uh, for a lot of help, you know, originally.You know, traditionally capital was not what it is today, you know, you didn\'t just go out and raise money and so we really bootstrapped due to his American Express. He mortgaged his house for the brand. His wife could not buy groceries, but she got some beautiful leather bags.And um and then when we were able to secure, you know, uh loans on purchase orders, you know, but he he was the CEO for 17 years, so it was integral to the growth of the brand that he was\n\nthere before, uh,\n\nI, I\'m thinking back now to a couple of months ago we talked to the Property Brothers and of course they\'re brothers, they\'ve launched this amazing brand and it seems to flow with them, you know, they.They each have different strengths. Like how did you manage working with yourbrother?\n\nSo it was critical that we get good at communication, and I write about it in the book. We didn\'t always see eye to eye. We didn\'t always get along, but we would kind of reset more than once a year and say this is what I need and want from you and this is what I need and want from you, and I think anyone who\'s working with their partner.Whether it\'s a spouse, a friend, you know, a stranger, you have to do those resets. I advise once a quarter because things change. You might have kids or you want to travel more or you start, you know, wanting to take the business in another direction. If you don\'t have those touch points, man, it can, it can get wild.\n\nItalked to a full disclosure, I talked to a lot of robotic AI CEOs, entrepreneurs that seemingly got born and thinking about developing businesses, but what do you see.I would say the more average entrepreneur in terms of mistakes like what are they making right now in this environment that you know folks that don\'t have access to billions of dollars in a in a huge\n\nrolodex. I think especially for women, most women are starting consumer businesses and they\'re all going after VC and private equity money and not going after traditional forms of capital, whether it\'s a small business loan or again purchase order financing, you\'re gonna grow slower, but it\'s OK. What is wrong with having a slower growing healthy business that provides a.Lifestyle for you, your family, and your employees, and it\'s one thing that my co-founder and I at Female Founder Collective, we talk to women about this. It\'s OK to grow slow. What happened to Main Street USA where there was just these beautiful businesses that, you know, provided a great lifestyle for the people that worked there? Our\n\nfemale founders, I mean, there\'s countless stories written about this, and there\'s nothing new per se, but are they getting the capital they need?\n\nNo, they\'re not. The numbers have actually gone down. It\'s now 1.8% down from 2%. It\'s awful. It\'s, it\'s disgusting actually. um, there need to be more.Advocates in the room, there need to be more women, you know, investing and succeeding and again our mission at Female Founder Collective is to hopefully make the next level of women who are successful that can then invest in more founders. Why\n\nis this still even an issue? Why is ita problem?\n\nI think it\'s a problem because again a lot of women have consumer businesses. They should not be getting VC capital for them, so they\'re barking up the wrong tree sometimes, and the business has been largely built, not in a bad way.By you know male dominated fields and sectors where it\'s more male heavy, and I think on that level men need to say OK we need to pull more managing directors in as women or we need more investors in as women or more funds need to come in as women and then really taking a look at the strength of these businesses because you\'ll find that the exits these women have are usually a lot bigger because we\'re so worried about failing and messing it up for everyone else that we\'re sort of like, OK, this has to.\n\nAre you a bigwork life balance person or or are you maybe I look at myself, it\'s just all become one big blob like there is no separation at allof any of this.\n\nThere is no such thing as balance.\n\nThank\n\nyou. It\'s never existed for men or women. It\n\njust doesn\'t exist. It does\n\nnot exist. I try and call it work life integration or we can call it the blob, as you say, um, you know, for me it\'s sort of like taking a look at my week, you know, where can I, where do I know I\'m gonna be gone for my kids for a couple of days, where can I then over index when I\'m back.But to me, you know, the village has been stripped of us. We used to have a village and I\'m sort of into rebuilding my village who, who are those people? My husband, you know, my nanny, my mom, my dad, like who\'s helping.Create this thing where it\'s not always falling on me and what can I shed? Do I do the dishes now? No, I don\'t. You know, someone does them and that\'s real nice. It\'s\n\nkind of hard. It\'s nice. It\'s hard to do. I mean, how do you, I mean, how do you manage your, your time, especially as you were growing a business and you\'re still growing a business? You\n\nknow, I\'m, I\'m very type A. Everything is scheduled within an inch of my life and I\'m a big list analog list maker, you know, and so I sort of have this is the fires, this is the must do, this is the nice to do, this is when I\'m bored and like daydreaming.And I sort of just manage my life of what\'s most important and what can I focus on today that that moves me along to the next cycle. You know,\n\nto that end, uh, I think we\'re, we\'re a lot alike. Uh, I\'m kind of getting that vibe. I just got the new Amazon Echo show because Alexa Plus is coming out and it\'s like Amazon\'s AI thing. It just manages your whole life.\n\nIt does. I need this in my life.\n\nI\'m when they come, it should be coming out in a couple weeks like this thing is, is pretty, pretty dope, but like let\'s let\'s go inside your brand.Uh, I remember when your bags came out. I remember when you made that famous t-shirt. I was a stock analyst covering ironically accessible luxury handbag makers at the time, so it was coach before tapestry. Like\n\nwhat\'s hot right now?\n\nWhat\'s hot right now in my space.I mean right now these micro trends that you see happening on TikTok, you know, everyone has to have, you know, the small bag that fits nothing. Cool, that lasts for a week and then it\'s and then it\'s something else and so I think you know what\'s hot right now is everything because trends are happening quicker and quicker and quicker.Uh, but for us we\'re really about building a stable base and foundation of bags that are your everyday woman\'s bags and then from there we layer on these blips as fast as we can get them out, but we\'re not, we\'re not pinning our business on that. Is\n\nTikTok a big driver of your business? and I ask that because I, I talked to the Abercrombie and Fitch folks and what they have seen in terms of.How they\'ve marketed on TikTok and the sales are able to drive with the conversion off of that has been mind blowing.\n\nWell, we\'ve just taken it seriously in the last 6 months, so it\'s something that I don\'t have numbers on yet, but we will be launching it soon in a very heavy way for TikTok shops.\n\nHow do youknow, how do you know when something\'s going to be a hit?\n\nOh man, sometimes you have that feeling and sometimes you don\'t, you know, we had a bag become a hit recently. Uh, it\'s the Megan hobo and when I saw the bag I was like that\'s a beautiful bag.But the timing of, you know, Bohemian kind of coming back along with a similar brand which I won\'t name doing a very big expensive campaign with a bag that looked very similar at the same time it\'s always like kismet, and you can\'t plan that. I didn\'t know they were gonna have a bag that looked the same, uh, and so sometimes that happens and then other times, you know, it\'s price value ratio that the customers like, wow, she sees me and she made a gorgeous looking bag for me at an accessible price point. Why\n\ndo trends.From decades ago come back and I, I was thinking I see everybody wearing like flared jeans again. I remember these when I was in high school in the late 90s. Uh and I\'m having flashbacks as I walked down thestreet.\n\nYeah, uh, uh, some of these trends, you know, make me cringe, you know, love Kendrick Lamar, but when I saw the bootleg with the, with the cuff under.The shoe that gave me like odd. I was like this cannot come back um everyone\'s nostalgic, you know, in our day, you know, we wanted things from the 70s, you know, corduroy and flared pants that are now back and so I think this next generation is embracing things we did in the 90s and sadly that,\n\nthat old jeans,\n\nof course I remember\n\nJingo jeans was.\n\nNow I want a\n\npair, but there\'s just in this environment of cost, I don\'t think you can make those profitably. I mean, I don\'t know. That\'s just my take, but the weird thing was they always drag on the grounds. You always went home dirty.\n\nYou always went home dirty. If you live in the city, you are burning those things when you get home. It was awful.\n\nHang with us, Rebecca. We\'re gonna go off for a quick break. I want to get more into your book and also the state of retail. We\'ll be right back on opening bid.All right, welcome back on Opening bid here at the NASDAQ in the, uh, big beautiful Times Square talking with Rebecca Minkoff, new book Fearless The New Rules for Unlocking Creativity, courage, and Success. I want to talk a little bit about the state of retail because there\'s a lot of focus on, of course, as you can imagine, tariffs. Now I\'ve never designed a product. I\'ve never worked in a supply chain.How hard is it to adapt to a tariff when you are in the apparel industry?\n\nIt\'s impossible. So we\'re not dealing with it this time around. We dealt with it the last time tariffs were instituted.I think that year we thought we were going to make $3 million and we lost $3 million. You know, it was impossible with the timeline set forth to change your supply chain. I went to testify, you know, and rally for it, didn\'t help, and so it\'s really hurting a lot of businesses. The silver lining is we got out of China at that time. We\'re still out of China.And so that saved us a lot of money in the long run, but it\'s pain we didn\'t need, you know, I wish there was a little bit more time to adjust to these tariffs because our life cycle is 9 months from concept to hitting the floor. So if you don\'t have that.And you know then you then you\'re out of\n\nluck. I,\n\nthe, the retail executives I talked to, they continue to tell me, well, we\'re moving out of China, we\'re going to Vietnam and we\'re going to Indonesia and on paper, great, but is it the same quality or does China have some kind of secret sauce they\'re still able to better things.Vietnam\n\nand you know we\'ve been making in Vietnam and Indonesia for the last 3 years, and I don\'t see a difference in our quality at all and I think that the smart factories were already establishing strongholds in those places, so some of the factories that made our goods in China are the same factories that just happened to be in Indonesia and in Vietnam. Can you\n\nmake an amazing handbag profitably in the\n\nUS?\n\nYou can if you charge a lot more money. So I did this exercise a couple of years ago when I had a lot of my, you know, 20 year old fans demanding Made in New York City, Made in the USA, and I said, Cool, this is the price. I\'m happy to do it. I can go back to my factory on 38th Street. Let me know if you want to pay, and guess what? Crickets, you know, I am excited by the prospect. I know LVMH.Investing in Texas and I would love manufacturing to come back but it has to come back on a scale that it\'s not just the make, you know, it\'s the hardware it\'s all the filler that\'s inside of a bag everything needs to be made here because if you\'re buying it all from overseas anyways and assembling it here, you\'re still not saving very much money.\n\nIs ita is it a skill thing? We just don\'t have the trades people to make this.\n\nI think it is a skill thing, but you can.Train them. I mean, what\'s incredible is the factory here that I started with that\'s still around still has some of the people that have worked here, you know, for the last 20 years so I think it can be taught it\'s just do people wanna do that anymore like engage in hand craft making\n\nit seems like it seems like fun, right?\n\nI love visiting the factory here.\n\nIs there, um, is the reality though that we\'re just gonna have to spend more.On apparel this spring and summer. I mean this is what\'s coming at us, right? Well, we\'re\n\ngonna have to spend more on everything. I think eggs here are $14. Eggs everything is more\n\nexpensive. Can we just have some eggs for under\n\n14\n\ndollars.\n\nI\'m going to get a chicken. It\'s happening.\n\nWell, you know, and it\'s, and it\'s interesting because, you know, I walk into, I guess some of your competitors. I\'m not gonna name any names, and I see the quality out of these products.I see they change zippers. I see they\'re using different fabric. Are we\'re just gonna get just less made good stuff as a result of this?\n\nI think a lot of brands are going to do that, and it\'s gonna hurt them in the end. It might be the quick fix for now, but the customer sees it like you said, you noticed it, and you are not, you know, an everyday handbag consumer. I\'m going to assume, but\n\nI still study this. I still, so I used to be. I covered all the the accessible luxury makers, handbag makers, but.It was always I remember the time where they reinvested in quality like, OK, we\'re gonna double down an amazing button or an amazing zipper, and I don\'t know it seems to be going the other way now again.\n\nIt is going the other way for a lot of brands. I know for us it\'s key that we remain a quality that you know I still meet women who have had the bag for 1516, 20 years, and I still want her to have that experience 20 years later when I\'m walking around with a cane.\n\nWhat\'s next for Rebecca Minkoff, the the brand, um, wherever that might be. I know you have the podcast, but even so with the company.\n\nSo with the company, as as we are celebrating 20 years, I have a couple more collaborations up my sleeve that\'ll come out in Q4 of this year, and we\'re just gonna continue to, you know, message our expansion, our regrowth. We\'re still coming back from COVID, where 70% of our business evaporated.And so what does business look like in in this new world and you know getting really good at TikTok?\n\nWhat is, what did you learn during the pandemic? I mean 70% of your business gone. I mean you must have been like tall shit like what, what, what, wheredid it go?\n\nYeah, well.I knew exactly where it went unfortunately but we couldn\'t do anything about that, you know, with every department store closing their doors and they had to cancel their purchase orders so I think the one thing it taught us is we need to mind and grow our own garden and if we are not doing that top of mind every day.Then we will be left in the dust and so it taught us to care about our relationship with our consumer in a new way, how we talk to her, when we talk to her, the look and feel of the website, what we stand for as a brand, and from there then you go out and sell to everybody else. But I think before that every conversation every morning was what was the sell through at Nordstrom, Sachs, Neiman.And instead of saying what what did we do yesterday in sales and so that flip I think was a game changer for us.\n\nHas it surprised you by how many I guess um department stores have closed?\n\nIt\'s surprising, it\'s scary you know I, I get nostalgic and that\'s where I loved to shop, but I think everyone has to innovate, you know, and I think everyone\'s trying to figure it out.Out and what\'s going to draw the customer back into their store? It has to be about experience, creativity. You gotta romance the customer and really edit, you know, everything today is available anywhere you look. I\'m seeking a good edit. I don\'t want to have to sort through 20 pages of a website. So if I walk into a store, what is your point of view and what story are you tellingme?\n\nYou think we\'re at the coming to the day where there\'s just not going to be department stores.\n\nI certainly hope that\'s not the\n\ncase. It\'s still fun. It\'s\n\nstill fun to walk in a department store. I mean they, they\'re trying. They\'re really trying. They\'re putting restaurants in there like coffee shops like I mean, I appreciate the efforts, but to your point, it does need to be edited. It still feels too expansive. It\'s over 2 or 3 floors, just like, I don\'t know, boil it down somehow.\n\nYeah, our, our actually our most successful footprint when we had stores was we did a pop up at the Grove. It was 1000 square feet.And boy did we have to edit. I think we had 5 SKUs, and it was our best performing store by far.\n\nWho do yougo to, you know, the last few minutes of, uh, of the podcast, we always love to get hot takes from our guests. So who do you go to for advice? Like who\'s your business outreach line?\n\nOh my gosh. Well, thank God for Female Founder Collective. So my co-founder Alison Wyatt.But then I have a great group of founders, Michelle Cordero Grant, who\'s, you know, Gorgi or Alison Ellsworth from Poppy, you know, I\'m always also seeking women outside of my industry to get a different perspective and lens. I could talk to designers still I\'m blue in the face, and we\'re all saying the same thing. And so for me it\'s critical that I have different people in way different industries that I\'m talkingto.\n\nWhat has made those founders click? like why have they found success?\n\nI think that they\'re brilliant marketers, they\'re creative, they\'re scrappy, and I think that they\'re continuing to surprise and delight their consumer and in this day and age you have to do that.\n\nWhere, um, you know, in terms of like finding success, you know, because it\'s around the cover of your book, you know how have you gone upon doing that how do you.\n\nI think success changes every couple of years. What you define it as when I started out, it was, can I afford to eat out?\n\nThat\'s always a good, yeah,\n\ncan I, can I pay mybills\n\nor can I afford to share the bill when someone says, let\'s just split the check and you\'re cringing inside because you had a salad.Uh, success to me these days is more time with my children. It\'s being unbothered by email on nights and weekends. Is that you can\'t do\n\nthat. You have to check. I do\n\nit. No, you don\'t check\n\nemail. No.\n\nI, you know what I do as I go and I delete the junk so that on Monday it\'s just a clean slate of everything I have to answer. That is all I do now and to me that\'s success. And then, you know, meeting my customer this last year has been about storytelling and about reminding her about the journey of the brand and so when I get to meet someone like last night who said my first bag.Was this purchase I made as a celebration of my raise. Like those are the things that make me go, yes, this is success.\n\nWhere do you, where do you shop and what are your statement\n\nitems? I mean, I\'m not gonna lie, but lately I\'ve been only shopping at Rebecca Minkoff.\n\nWell,that\'s good. Like you have to go to other competitors stuff, right? I mean,\n\ncome on. So I actually haven\'t bought another competitor\'s stuff in a long time, but I do love Isabel Marant and I think she makes a beautiful product. Um, it is more.Expensive, but when I\'m splurging, that\'s who I go to.\n\nAlright, totally last one, I promise. Like what are the style mistakes you still see menmaking?\n\nMen making. Oh gosh, so men talking about doing these things, uh, I, you know, I know that skinny jeans are back for women, but they\'re not certainly not back for men. Embrace the loose pants.\n\nI\n\ncan\'t,\n\nI can\'t do the loose pants.\n\nGet a nicely tailored suit or do the Harry Styles thing and just really go the opposite direction, do the boxy suit, but it has to be the right boxy, you know,\n\nyou know I\'ve seen.Everything is baggy. You think we\'re just not going back to like tighter fits? No,\n\nIthink it\'s happening. I, I saw many men last night dressed up in tight suits, and I was like, Too soon, too soon, not yet. OK.\n\nWell, congrats on\n\nthis book, Rebecca McGough, Fearless, the new rules for unlocking creativity, courage and success. Really good to see you and, and congrats on all your success. Thank you for having me. All right, and that\'s it for the latest episode of Opening bid. Continue this with all those likes on the podcast platforms. Thumbs up on YouTube.

Companies are struggling to adjust to constantly changing trade policies, leading to temporary fixes like increased air shipping and stockpiling of goods.\n\nUS President Donald Trump\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump\'s new tariff plan has the\n\non edge as he stokes a\n\ndestined to stanch transport demand and send companies scrambling to manage the fallout.\n\nThe Trump administration on Wednesday is set to announce "reciprocal tariffs" targeting nations that have duties on U.S. goods. That move would come after it slapped new import levies on products from Mexico, China and Canada - the top U.S. trading partners - as well as on goods including steel and autos.\n\nMajor\n\nlike MSC, Maersk , CMA CGM and Hapag-Lloyd transport towering piles of colorful boxes stuffed with goods for U.S. customers like Walmart, Target and Home Depot .\n\nThey are giants in the roughly $14 trillion a year ocean shipping industry that handles about 80% of global trade. They are also reliant on companies that are getting whipsawed by Trump\'s escalating, on-and-off tariffs. "The implementation of stacked tariffs has led to mounting confusion," said Blake Harden, the Retail Industry Leaders Association\'s vice president of international trade. "Companies have not had adequate time, certainty, and guidance they need to incorporate these changes and comply."\n\nTrump has invoked emergency powers to swiftly add, and occasionally retract and reinstate, tariffs during his second term in office.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### Live Events\n\n"Importers don\'t know from one week to the next what their duty cost is going to be," said Kit Johnson, director of import compliance at John S. James Co., a U.S.\n\nand freight forwarder whose customers include automakers and producers of chemicals, machinery, medical devices and textiles.\n\nJohnson has seen an uptick in customers opting for high-cost air shipping for autos and other goods that normally would travel by sea, in a bid to front-run new tariffs.\n\nU.S. container imports have also surged to record levels in recent months as companies rushed in toys, furniture, bedding, machinery and parts from China, the world\'s No. 1 exporter, to avoid Trump\'s tariffs.\n\nAs that threat expanded, other vessel types and airplanes have been called to help U.S. firms stockpile cars from Europe and the Far East, cheese and wine from Italy, and prescription drugs from Ireland.\n\nThe average on-demand spot rate to ship a 40-foot container on the key Far East to U.S. West Coast route was $2,844 on Tuesday, a one-day gain of almost 16%, according to data from freight pricing platform Xeneta. That rate is still lower than a year ago, when the risk of Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping lanes was a new phenomenon and trading was not distorted by importers seeking to avoid tariffs.\n\n## Tariffs take a bite\n\n#### Read More News on\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n#### Read More News on\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n- How Gensol crashed Indian cab rider’s blue darling\n- HDFC Bank vs. ICICI: Which should be your value bet?\n- How IPL franchises play the profit and power game in cricket\'s billion-dollar battle\n- India has a major health insurance headache\n- Stock Radar: Why is Bharti Airtel stock looking attractive on charts; trading above 200-DMA\n- Volatility is integral to the market, take advantage of it: 6 mid-caps from different sectors with an upside potential of up to 47%\n\n- 1\n- 2\n- 3\n\n## Videos\n\n- Val Kilmer dies at 65 after battling Pneumonia\n- Lok Sabha: Discussion on The Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025\n- \'Traffickers made $13-15B\': Gracias reveals SSN fraud\n- Trump admin begins layoffs at HHS\n- Trump’s pick for Chief of Staff faces grilling\n- GOP targets ‘rogue judges’ blocking Trump’s agenda\n- Trump hints at possible DOGE shutdown\n- Trump’s Liberation Day: ₹3.2L Cr Wiped Out\n- Houthis \'destroy\' another US MQ-9 Reaper drone\n- Sunita Williams on India from space: ‘A glowing web of lights...’\n\n- 1\n- 2\n- 3\n\nLatest from ET\n\n- A supply chain quirk got Air India 50 Boeing jets made for China\n- 5 sectors on knife\'s edge as Trump to drop tariff bomb\n- Waqf Bill 1995 vs 2024: What are the key changes\n\n- April Fool Day MemesEaster 2025CoreWeave’s $23 billion IPOSocial Security Benefits\n- MS-13 leader arrested in VirginiaBen Affleck Jennifer Lopez DivorceUS Gas Prices Dropangel numbers\n- Pete HegsethNYT Mini Crossword todayNYT Strands puzzle answersWordle March 12 answer\n- Recession in 2025Sudiksha KonankiCrypto SummitUS stock market today\n- zodiac signsNYT StrandsGold price today March 07Nvidia stock down\n- Donald Trump signs\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Popular in International\n\n- Double trouble for Pete Hegseth?

Their widespread adoption highlights their enormous utility and exposes their limitations in making domain-specific business decisions beyond text generation.\n- While LLMs generate coherent text, they lack a native understanding of business rules, regulatory policies, and operational constraints. This makes them insufficient for real-world decision-making processes that require structured optimization beyond language synthesis.\n- Techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or fine-tuning an LLM can steer outputs to a certain limit. Still, they cannot encode business-specific constraints or generate structured, executable strategies as effectively as a domain-specific generative model.\n- As image-based generative models generate images instead of text, domain-specific generative models can be trained to learn operational constraints and develop optimal business strategies, offering structured decision-making capabilities beyond descriptive outputs.\n- Unlike general-purpose LLMs, domain-specific models require significantly smaller datasets and fewer parameters, making them cost-effective and computationally feasible while enabling automation and AI-driven core business decision intelligence at scale.\n\nThe advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT has revolutionized industries by enabling text-based automation, thanks to their amazing text-generation capabilities. However, true business value goes beyond just text generation.\n\nA recent Boston Consulting Group (BCG) report\\(^1\\) highlights that 62% of the value generated by AI across industries comes from core business functions such as supply chain, operations, and revenue-generating processes. Only 38% comes from support functions like customer service. It further states that, out of all the organizations engaging with AI, only 26% have managed to go beyond the Proof of Concept (PoC) stage. Of this, just 4% generate cutting-edge value consistently.\n\nWhat sets these leaders apart? The report highlights that successful organizations invest 70% of their AI transformation effort in \'People and Processes\' compared to only 20% in technology and 10% in algorithms. This strategic focus allows them to align AI initiatives closely with their core business processes, facilitating new revenue streams alongside productivity improvements. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved customer service interactions and content generation, they inherently lack the capability to understand domain-specific constraints and business rules, creating a clear barrier for embedding AI deeply into operational decision-making.\n\n#### Related Sponsored Content\n\nEven advanced approaches like Agentic AI built on top of Large Language Models (LLMs) primarily achieve workflow orchestration through text-based chain-of-thought prompting. However, it remains at the text level without embedding any domain-specific business knowledge.\n\nTherefore, to truly integrate AI with core business processes, LLMs alone are not sufficient, and industries (such as logistics, finance, and utilities) require AI that generates optimal, actionable, decision-driven output under real-time conditions and constraints rather than descriptive text. For instance:\n\n- A logistics firm does not need an AI model to describe how to optimize routes. Instead, given current conditions, it needs an AI model capable of generating optimized route schedules.\n- A utility company does not need an LLM to summarize grid restoration plans. Rather, it requires an AI that is able to produce executable restoration sequences in real time, considering current weather, location, crew availability, safety norms, and company policies.\n\nThis article explores and proposes a shift from text-based AI to domain-specific Generative AI, models that understand operational constraints, real-world dynamics, and business rules to generate executable strategies, not just text descriptions.\n\n## Current Generative AI Landscape\n\nGenerative AI has come a long way since its first public adoption, driven by rapid technological advancement and increasing financial investments. The Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 makes this trend clear beyond doubt. The report states that 149 new foundational models were released in 2023 alone, more than double the number in 2022. It goes on to say that the number of AI Patent grants from 2021 to 2022 skyrocketed by 62.7% and that the number of AI-related projects on GitHub has gone from 845 in 2011 to about 1.8 million in 2023\\(^2\\). On the financial investments side, funding for Generative AI in 2023 surged to $25.2 billion, nearly 8 times from 2022\\(^2\\). This growing influx of capital underscores the growing industry confidence in the commercial potential and capabilities of Generative AI.\n\nDelving deeper into this landscape, out of the 149 new foundational models released in 2023, about 65.7% were open source, reflecting a significant shift towards a larger open-source footprint and democratization of Generative AI model development. However, the highest-performing models, such as OpenAI\'s GPT-4 and Google\'s Gemini Ultra, reflecting the latest state-of-the-art, remained proprietary, closed-source industry-driven systems, with Gemini Ultra achieving human-level performance milestones on the Massive Multitasking Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark.\n\nThis landscape indicates Generative AI\'s rapidly growing maturity. It also highlights the growing industry footprint of Generative AI as it becomes more accessible and advanced. However, the same \'Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024\'\\(^2\\) also points out that the computation cost of training frontier models has risen steeply. For example, GPT-4’s training cost soared to $78 million, while Gemini Ultra’s cost was an unprecedented $191 million.\n\nAs a result, most industry players are restricted to drawing value from orchestration over general-purpose LLMs and image models trained by a few AI players with the means and resources to do so at a large scale. Not that this pattern has any less value, but these general-purpose models excel primarily in text/image generation and general reasoning tasks, leaving a gap in the area of domain-specific generative models that could be engineered from the ground up to produce structured, actionable, and optimized business decisions in real-time.\n\n## LLMs Vs Domain-Specific Generative Models\n\nSo, what is the difference between LLMs and Domain-Specific Generative Models?\n\nLLMs like GPT-4 are autoregressive models based on the Transformer architecture, first described by Vaswani et al. (2017)\\(^3\\), generating outputs by sequentially predicting the next token(s) conditioned on the preceding context. Transformers rely on self-attention mechanisms that allow the model to weigh different words relative to each other when generating text. During training, an LLM processes vast quantities of textual data to learn an approximate probability distribution (representing a space from which the observed training data could be sampled, with the highest possible likelihood).\n\nOnce trained, the model generates text by sequential sampling from this learned distribution based on the provided input text. This is why LLMs are remarkably effective in tasks involving natural language, such as translations, conversational interactions, summarization, etc. However, this kind of output only reflects learned statistical patterns of textual data, lacking explicit understanding of domain-specific rules or relationships. The architecture below is based on principles from Vaswani et al. (2017)\\(^3\\) and Radford et al. (2019)\\(^4\\).\n\nFigure 1: A generalized representation of Transformer-based LLM architecture inspired by Vaswani et al. (2017) and Radford et al. (2019)\n\nBy contrast, Domain-Specific Generative Models can be designed to explicitly learn from structured, operational data unique to a particular business domain, embedding domain rules and constraints directly into their generative process. Similarly to LLMs, they can be trained using the autoregressive principle followed by some optimization techniques like GFlowNet\\(^5\\).\n\nStill, unlike general-purpose LLMs, they do not merely reproduce statistically plausible text. Instead, they generate executable, decision-driven outputs tailored to real-time business conditions and constraints. This makes them uniquely suitable for integration into operational workflows, where reliable, structured, and actionable outputs, rather than descriptive text, are essential.\n\n### Under the Hood: Brief Introduction to Autoregressive Generative Models\n\nAutoregressive generative models are probabilistic models that generate outputs sequentially by sampling from a joint probability distribution, where each step is conditioned on all the previous events. This joint probability distribution is learned during offline training, using observed real-world event sequences as data points.\n\nDuring training, the model assigns conditional probabilities across the event space, adjusting its parameters such that historically observed events (actual data points) receive the highest likelihood under the learned distribution. These models are widely used in applications where structured dependencies matter, such as natural language processing, time-series forecasting, and, in our case, strategic decision-making.\n\nIn summary, the Autoregressive process estimates the joint probability of an event sequence X as:\n\n\\(P(X) = p(x\\_1) p(x\\_2 \\mid x\\_1) p(x\\_3 \\mid x\\_1, x\\_2) \\dots p(x\\_d \\mid x\\_1, x\\_2, \\dots, x\\_{d-1}) \\)\n\nWhere:\n\n- X is a feature vector consisting of individual features.\n- \\(x\\_1, x\\_2, x\\_3, \\dots, x\\_{d-1}, x\\_d\\) are individual features representing business events.\n\nThis means the model learns how each step influences the next, making it well-suited for generating structured, decision-driven sequences, whether textual or non-textual data.\n\nFigure 2: An ideal Auto-Regressive Process\n\nWhy not Just Use LLMs?\n\nLLMs are autoregressive models trained on vast text corpora, making them powerful for text generation but not inherently suited for business decision modeling. An LLM simply produces highly probable text sequences based on its training data.\n\nBy contrast, a domain-specific autoregressive model can be trained on structured historical business data such as supply chain events or logistics optimizations. As a result, instead of generating the next highest probability word in a sentence, a domain-specific model would sample the next highest probability decision in a business process from its learned probability distribution incorporating business constraints and operational metrics.\n\nEmbedding Domain Constraints\n\nUnlike generic autoregressive models, domain-specific models incorporate constraints directly into training, ensuring generated sequences comply with operational, security, and regulatory policies. These constraints can be:\n\n- Hard Constraints: Fixed rules (e.g., delivery deadlines, compliance &amp; regulations).\n- Soft Constraints: Optimizable objectives (e.g., minimizing cost, maximizing efficiency).\n\nBy learning from structured domain-specific event sequences rather than generic text, this approach allows businesses to automate strategic decision-making at scale, moving beyond LLM-based workflow orchestration to truly embedded AI-driven operations.\n\nWhat happens if the real-world data is suboptimal?\n\nA key challenge in training domain-specific autoregressive models is that real-world data is often suboptimal. The learned probability distribution will naturally optimize to replicate patterns observed in the dataset. Still, if historical business decisions were inefficient or constrained by past limitations, the model will inherently generate similarly suboptimal outputs. This is precisely why we required this domain-specific approach in the first place - to optimize existing suboptimal core business processes.\n\nFor this reason, training should combine an autoregressive learning process with a reward-based optimization loop (such as GFlowNet)\\(^5\\). This ensures that the model is nudged towards sequences that maximize specific business objectives instead of blindly replicating past behaviors.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Logistics Routing :\n    - Problem: Historical supply chain data may show suboptimal delivery schedules, where shipments were frequently delayed due to poor route selection or fixed scheduling rules instead of adapting to real-time traffic, weather, or fleet conditions.\n    - Solution: First, the model learns from past data, but then it optimizes routes by maximizing a reward function to minimize delivery time, reduce costs, and balance fleet load.\n- Retail Demand Forecasting &amp; Inventory Allocation :\n    - Problem: Due to rigid replenishment rules, a retailer’s historical inventory decisions might reflect overstocking in low-demand areas or understocking in high-demand locations.\n    - Solution: The model initially learns from past replenishment data but re-weights its probability distribution based on dynamic factors (seasonality, competitor pricing, and foot traffic data) to generate adaptive, revenue-optimized restocking plans.\n\nBy iteratively refining the learned distribution with optimal sequences, businesses can move from descriptive AI (mimicking past decisions) to prescriptive AI (actively improving decision-making)\\(^6\\).\n\n## Shifting from Text to Model-Native Action: Core Differences\n\nWhile LLMs have revolutionized AI adoption, their reliance on text-based probability distributions makes integrating them into structured decision-making processes difficult. This is why 74% of organizations fail to go beyond the proof-of-concept (PoC) stage. Their AI adoption stops at generating descriptive text rather than producing structured, executable business actions. This is not to deny the enormous credit that LLMs rightly get for triggering the current AI transformations. However, they are more difficult to fully and seamlessly integrate with core business processes than domain-specific generative AI. Let\'s examine this claim to investigate the core differences.\n\nLLMs are trained to generate text by modeling the statistical likelihood of word sequences from vast datasets. They do not inherently understand business logic, constraints, or real-world operations. LLMs merely generate text that is statistically probable based on prior text corpora. This makes them ill-suited for decision-driven business processes like logistics, finance, or energy optimization. This model simply samples text from this learned probability distribution conditioned on the user-provided input text. In order to adapt a model like this to the core business process of a logistics company (e.g., the constraints and policies governing decisions about a route plan), one must do the following:\n\n1. Provide the model with a textual knowledge base (that it can potentially store in memory) detailing a map of shipping hubs, company policies, various countries\' specific rules, etc.\n2. Use prompt engineering with system prompts to lead the model in generating instructions for the route plan.\n\nThe model can then provide a meaningful and coherent text description of how to run a route plan, but it does not understand the real business rules. The result is not reliable, repeatable, or easily integrated with existing business processes.\n\nUnlike LLMs, domain-specific generative models are trained directly on structured, real-world business decisions. Instead of merely generating plausible text, these models learn how business constraints, such as logistics rules, compliance policies, cost structures, and risk factors, affect operational strategies. This training makes models inherently better-suited for structured decision-making and real-time execution than LLMs, which require extensive prompt engineering and external filtering. This direct training of models leads to minimizing shipping time, maximizing security, minimizing cost, and so on. An agent framework built on top of this model will integrate seamlessly with the company\'s core business process as it generates optimized, executable route plans.\n\n## Key Architectural Principles\n\nThis section outlines the core architectural principles required to build and integrate domain-specific generative AI models into enterprise systems. The architecture consists of two primary components:\n\n- Offline Training Architecture – Learning from structured historical business event sequences.\n- Online Sampling and Generation – Generating real-time, optimized decision strategies.\n\n1. Offline Training: Learning from Historical Business Data\n\n- The offline training pipeline is designed to capture historical business event sequences and transform them into learned probability distributions using Autoregressive Neural Networks followed by GFlowNet or Reinforcement Learning (RL) optimization.\n- Enterprise Data Collection: Business events from various transactional systems (e.g., order management, operations, pricing, logistics, etc.) are captured using event-driven mechanisms such as Kafka streaming pipelines.\n- Feature Engineering &amp; Encoding: Events are transformed, aggregated, cleansed, and vectorized before being stored as structured datasets.\n- Constraint Integration: Business constraints, security policies, and organizational constraints are dynamically fetched and encoded into the feature space.\n- Model Training Process:\n    - Autoregressive Probability Modeling: The first stage models the probability distribution P(X) of sequential decision-making events using a Neural Autoregressive Estimator.\n    - Optimization using GFlowNet: The second stage optimizes the learned probability distribution to yield an optimized distribution P(X\'), adjusting it to favor optimal strategies through reward-based fine-tuning.\n- Versioned Training Pipeline: The model undergoes scheduled re-training on newly available business events, ensuring it stays current.\n\nThe trained model at the end of this pipeline represents a learned, domain-specific probability distribution, capturing decision patterns that can be sampled in real time.\n\nFigure 3: Offline Training &amp; Deployment\n\n[Click here to expand image above to full-size]\n\n2. Online Sampling: Generating Optimal Decision Sequences\n\nOnce trained, the model is deployed into a real-time enterprise workflow to dynamically generate optimized strategies and decision sequences.\n\n- Event-Driven Architecture: Live transactional business events (e.g., warehouse routing updates, logistics route planning, pricing fluctuations) continuously stream into an enterprise event hub (Kafka Platform).\n- Agentic AI API Layer: This layer interacts with external systems, receiving real-time business inputs and fetching necessary constraints (security policies, regulatory norms, custom business rules).\n- Business Events Encoding: The incoming transactional events are encoded into feature vectors before being used as input for inference.\n- Generative AI Model Execution:\n    - Autoregressive Sampling: The foundational autoregressive model samples from P(X), generating an initial decision sequence.\n    - GFlowNet or RL-Based Refinement: The policy optimization network further refines these outputs, ensuring decisions align with business goals (e.g., cost minimization, efficiency maximization).\n- Decision Deployment &amp; Execution: The generated optimized decision strategy is sent back into business systems (e.g., routing systems in logistics, pricing adjustments in e-commerce, restoration strategies in energy utilities).\n\nFigure 4: Online Sampling and Output\n\n[Click here to expand image above to full-size]\n\n## Implementation Challenges\n\nDeveloping domain-specific AI is not without its unique challenges. These difficulties arise from data availability, model complexity, and deployment constraints. Let\'s examine each one.\n\n1. Data Availability: Many industry players have historically not designed their systems to collect and retain data, let alone the high-quality data required to create feature vectors representing sequences of business events to train AI models. The situation worsens when we observe that most industry players have less than optimal implementations of enterprise-wide source-of-truth data models. This means that business data is fragmented in many systems that work in silos and do not understand each other\'s data models. For example, the CRM system within an enterprise may be completely disconnected from the ERP system, which does not correlate with the billing system and so on. Although AI models should be able to learn correlation from raw data from each of these systems, a minimum level of correlation is needed to create the feature vectors required for training.\n2. Model Complexity: Domain-specific generative models must do more than generate plausible outputs. They must understand and enforce business rules, constraints, and industry-specific policies. For example, some rules (e.g., regulatory compliance) must be strictly enforced, while others (e.g., cost-efficiency trade-offs) require flexible optimization. Similarly, the model must balance competing objectives, such as simultaneously optimizing for speed, cost, and compliance. Also, unlike LLMs that generate free-form text, decision-generating models must produce structured, executable outputs aligned with business workflows.\n3. Deployment: Deployments are challenging because the model deployment requires an offline version to train the model and an online version that samples real-time transactional business inputs from the learned model. This increases the deployment\'s complexity and makes the team constitution more complex because now you need data scientists and AI engineers collaborating with the application development teams. Deployments also put pressure on the enterprise recruitment process. Many industries rely on decades-old IT infrastructure that cannot natively integrate AI-driven decision-making, and deployments must still deal with this situation. Lastly, since operational strategies and business decision-making involve AI, there must be some way of continuously auditing and verifying the correctness of AI-generated outputs. This is very challenging when it comes to semi-automated processes with human involvement.\n\n## Future Outlook and ROI\n\nAs organizations increasingly seek AI-driven transformation beyond text-based automation, domain-specific generative models are poised to become the next major leap in AI adoption. This shift extends beyond cost reduction, offering opportunities for core business process transformation, new revenue-generating innovations, operational excellence, and scalability across industries.\n\n1. Scalability across domains: While we focused on the logistics and supply business domain, the same foundational approach can be applied to numerous industries where decision-making involves structured, sequential processes.\n    - Healthcare: Optimizing hospital resource allocation, patient scheduling, and clinical workflow automation.\n    - Manufacturing: AI-driven supply chain coordination and production scheduling.\n    - Finance: Enhancing fraud detection, credit risk assessment, and algorithmic trading strategies.\n    - Retail: AI-powered inventory management, personalized promotions, and dynamic pricing strategies.\n2. Operational Excellence: Unlike traditional analytics tools, which rely on rule-based systems, domain-specific generative AI models can drive continuous, adaptive optimization. For example, a pharmaceutical company could use a domain-specific model to optimize drug production schedules based on raw material availability, regulatory constraints, and global demand forecasts, achieving faster time-to-market while minimizing waste.\n3. Strong Return on Investment (ROI), with lower training costs: One of the strongest advantages of domain-specific generative AI is that it does not require the massive computational resources needed to train large LLMs like GPT or Claude. Why domain-specific models are likely to deliver strong ROI -\n    - Smaller, More Targeted Models: Unlike LLMs that require training on trillions of tokens, domain-specific models can be trained on proprietary, industry-specific data, reducing compute requirements.\n    - More Precision: Training is narrowly focused on business constraints and operational strategies, meaning it is feasible to achieve high accuracy.\n    - Faster Time to Value: Since these models don’t need to be generalized across multiple domains, enterprises can deploy them faster and start seeing business impact sooner.\n    - Ongoing Optimization: Unlike LLMs, which often require expensive retraining, domain-specific models can be incrementally updated with new business data, keeping costs lower over time.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has reshaped AI’s role in business, but true AI-driven transformation requires models that go beyond generating text. To fully unlock AI’s business value, enterprises must shift toward strategy-based AI models that can learn from domain-specific historical data, embed constraints, and generate optimal, actionable decisions rather than just text descriptions.\n\nThis article introduced a new perspective: Agentic AI is not limited to text-based workflows. While LLMs can power automation through prompt-driven orchestration, domain-specific generative models offer direct integration with core business processes. These models are uniquely suited to industries where real-time decision-making, operational constraints, and domain expertise play a crucial role, such as logistics, finance, healthcare, and beyond. As AI leaders, researchers, and business decision-makers, we need to decide:\n\n- Will AI remain an assistive tool that is limited to automating support functions?\n- Or will AI evolve into an engine for decision-making, driving industry-specific intelligence and business transformation?\n\nIt’s time for enterprises to reimagine AI as an active decision-maker rather than just a language-based assistant. Industry leaders and AI researchers must collaborate to shape the future of AI-driven decision intelligence, one in which we can use AI for core business process transformations at scale.\n\n## References\n\n\\(^1\\)\xa0Nicolas de Bellefonds, Tauseef Charanya, \xa0Marc Roman Franke, \xa0Jessica Apotheker, \xa0Patrick Forth, \xa0Michael Grebe, \xa0Amanda Luther, \xa0Romain de Laubier, \xa0Vladimir Lukic, \xa0Mary Martin, Clemens Nopp, and Joe Sassine, "Where’s the Value in AI?".\n\n\\(^2\\)\xa0Nestor Maslej, Loredana Fattorini, Raymond Perrault, Vanessa Parli, Anka Reuel, Erik Brynjolfsson, John Etchemendy, Katrina Ligett, Terah Lyons, James Manyika, Juan Carlos Niebles, Yoav Shoham, Russell Wald, and Jack Clark, "The AI Index 2024 Annual Report", AI Index Steering Committee, Institute for Human-Centered AI, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, April 2024.\n\n\\(^3\\)\xa0Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit, Llion Jones, Aidan N.

The vulnerability is a privilege escalation vulnerability that impacts the Core Media framework. The Apple Core Media framework supports multimedia tasks like playback, recording, and manipulation of audio and video on iOS and macOS devices. The company addressed the use-after-free issue with improved memory management.\n\n- CVE-2025-24200\xa0(CVSS score: 4.6) – In February, Apple released emergency security updates to address a zero-day vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-24200, that the company believes was exploited in “extremely sophisticated” targeted attacks. An attacker could have exploited the vulnerability to disable the USB Restricted Mode “on a locked device.” Apple’s\xa0USB Restricted Mode\xa0is a security feature introduced in iOS 11.4.1 to protect devices from unauthorized access via the Lightning port. The USB Restricted Mode disables the data connection of the iPhone’s Lightning port after a specific\xa0interval of\xa0time, but it doesn’t interrupt the charging process. Any other data transfer\xa0would require the user to provide the passcode. The IT giant fixed the vulnerability with improved state management.\n\n- CVE-2025-24201\xa0(CVSS score: 8.8) – In March, Apple released emergency security updates to address a zero-day vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-24201, in the WebKit cross-platform web browser engine. The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write issue that was exploited in “extremely sophisticated” attacks. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability using maliciously crafted web content to escape the Web Content sandbox. Apple released this fix as an additional measure after blocking a similar attack in iOS 17.2.\n\nApple released the following updates:\n\n- CVE-2025-24085 –\xa0macOS Sonoma 14.7.5,\xa0macOS Ventura 13.7.5, and\xa0iPadOS 17.7.6\n- CVE-2025-24200 –\xa0iOS 15.8.4, iPadOS 15.8.4,\xa0iOS 16.7.11, and iPadOS 16.7.11\n- CVE-2025-24201 –\xa0iOS 15.8.4, iPadOS 15.8.4,\xa0iOS 16.7.11, and iPadOS 16.7.11\n\nthat are available for the following devices:\n\n- iOS 15.8.4 and iPadOS 15.8.4 – iPhone 6s (all models), iPhone 7 (all models), iPhone SE (1st generation), iPad Air 2, iPad mini (4th generation), and iPod touch (7th generation)\n- iOS 16.7.11 and iPadOS 16.7.11 – iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPad 5th generation, iPad Pro 9.7-inch, and iPad Pro 12.9-inch 1st generation\n- iPadOS 17.7.6 – iPad Pro 12.9-inch 2nd generation, iPad Pro 10.5-inch, and iPad 6th generation\n\nFollow me on Twitter:\xa0@securityaffairs\xa0and\xa0Facebook\xa0and\xa0Mastodon\n\nPierluigi\xa0Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs\xa0–\xa0hacking,\xa0newsletter)\n\n#### you might also like\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n##### New Triada Trojan comes preinstalled on Android devices\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n##### New advanced FIN7\'s Anubis backdoor allows to gain full system control on Windows\n\n#### leave a comment\n\n#### newsletter\n\n###### Subscribe to my email list and stay\n up-to-date!\n\n#### recent articles\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n###### New Triada Trojan comes preinstalled on Android devices\n\nMalware / April 03, 2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n###### New advanced FIN7\'s Anubis backdoor allows to gain full system control on Windows\n\nMalware / April 02, 2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n###### U.S. CISA adds Apache Tomcat flaw to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog\n\nSecurity / April 02, 2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n###### Apple backported fixes for three actively exploited flaws to older devices\n\nSecurity / April 02, 2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n###### Spike in Palo Alto Networks scanner activity suggests imminent cyber threats\n\nHacking / April 02, 2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo contact me write an email to:\n\n\n                            Pierluigi Paganini : \n\n[email\xa0protected]\n\n#### QUICK LINKS\n\n- Home\n- Cyber Crime\n- Cyber warfare\n- APT\n- Data Breach\n- Deep Web\n- Digital ID\n- Hacking\n- Hacktivism\n- Intelligence\n- Internet of Things\n- Laws and regulations\n- Malware\n- Mobile\n- Reports\n- Security\n- Social Networks\n- Terrorism\n- ICS-SCADA\n- POLICIES\n- Contact me\n\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2024\n\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Walmart promised to slash a gigaton of carbon emissions from its supply chain, and the world’s largest money manager, BlackRock, with its $11 trillion in investments, pressured companies to come up with a plan to zero out their emissions by 2050.\n\nNow, many corporations are avoiding the subject altogether. During earnings calls, mentions of many well-known terms related to the climate are down 76 percent compared to three years ago, according to a recent analysis of S&amp;P 500 companies by Bloomberg. The sharpest declines came from financial firms and consumer discretionary companies, the category for those offering optional purchases, like Starbucks and Airbnb.\n\nThe hesitancy to talk about climate change — sometimes called “greenhushing” — could decrease pressure on the big corporate polluters that have been slow to cut their emissions. The trend has been linked to a growing backlash against sustainable investing, as well as a shifting political landscape with President Donald Trump’s second term underway. “I think large companies in particular today are very, very cautious,” said Hortense Bioy, the head of sustainable investing research for Morningstar, a financial services firm.\n\nCompanies have been caught in a tug-of-war: On one hand, investors are pressuring them to be serious about the risks of climate change to their business. On the other, the mention of any word related to so-called ESG — the polarizing acronym that refers to “environmental, social, and governance” investing — threatens blowback from the Trump administration. The way to thread the needle, experts suggest, is to stay away from flashpoints like ESG and talk specifically about the financial risks that the warming planet poses to companies.\n\nGrist thanks its sponsors.

Here's How\n\nJohn Marshall, the CEO of the Potential Energy Coalition, a nonpartisan marketing firm focused on climate action, says that silence isn’t a winning strategy. “We do not think that voters or consumers are at all impressed, regardless of their political stripes, by taking the concept of climate change out of any language,” Marshall said.\n\nHis research shows that investors and the public want companies to talk about climate change — as an investment risk, not a matter of morality. According to a Potential Energy report from last September, 3 in 4 Americans surveyed think companies have a responsibility to limit their impact on the climate. What’s more, roughly 9 in 10 U.S. retail investors want companies to reduce emissions and prepare for the ways increasingly unpredictable weather could lead to risks like supply chain disruptions and rising insurance costs.\n\nThe first signs of greenhushing appeared in 2023, when the Swiss consultancy South Pole found that a quarter of large companies around the world had decided not to publicize their progress on climate targets. The reason, South Pole later found, was that companies wanted to avoid the legal risks that came with high-profile pledges. It was a response to countries crafting new laws against “greenwashing,” the term for deceptive environmental advertising.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt the same time, financial institutions were already dealing with the backlash against ESG, which heated up in 2022. Lawsuits targeted asset managers, pension funds, and federal agencies, claiming that “woke capitalism” was putting politics over financial interests. Red states including Florida and Texas pulled billions in state funds out of BlackRock and other ESG-friendly firms. BlackRock, which in 2021 had supported almost half of shareholder proposals to address environmental and social issues, pulled a U-turn. Between July 2023 and June 2024, it only backed 4 percent of them.\n\nGrist thanks its sponsors.

Here's How\n\n“They were too visible and too vocal about what they were doing in that space,” Bioy said. She expects that companies with big climate plans may now have to disclose the opposition to ESG as a risk in their annual reports. That sense of caution is showing up in the markets, too: Over the last two years, there has been more money leaving sustainable funds in the U.S. than what’s coming in, according to Morningstar’s research.\n\nBioy suspects that trend still has room to run, given Trump’s hostility to climate action. In December, corporations including Apple, Walmart, and Siemens failed to sign an open letter reaffirming their commitment to the Paris Agreement, a letter organized by the climate coalition they joined after Trump’s first presidential victory in 2016. Bioy pointed to the guidance circulating in government organizations warning against using terms like “pollution,” “clean energy,” and “climate science.” “Companies that do business with the administration or any state organization, they will be careful not to use those terms,” Bioy said.\n\nIn the past, some companies have used language around climate change that embraced a moral framing, such as “do the right thing.” But most people don’t think that’s the province of what businesses should be doing, Marshall said. Two-thirds of Americans believe that businesses should avoid taking a stance on political issues, according to his firm’s research. The moral framing provokes backlash because it feels like “forcing an idea on somebody,” Marshall said. “We have seen it’s much more effective to have language in the business community that’s about money and reality.”\n\nIt raises the broader question of how regular people should talk about climate change when many of the terms environmental advocates use can provoke a knee-jerk reaction. “I think that the climate movement needs to be very thoughtful about and strategic about whether or not it is a DEI or ESG initiative,” said Austin Whitman, CEO of The Change Climate Project, a nonprofit offering tools to help businesses cut their emissions. “I think for all of us across the spectrum, regardless of what cause we’re fighting for, we need to distance ourselves from these lightning-rod acronyms and topics that are really easy to just cut down with a single swipe.”\n\nThis story has been updated to clarify Apple and other corporations’ involvement in the climate coalition they joined.\n\nA message from\n\n#### All donations DOUBLED for a limited time\n\nGrist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable solutions to climate change.

Should\'ve gone to third-party support\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInternational optometry company Specsavers has paused the global standardization of its Oracle ERP system and moved to third-party support, saving £5 million ($6.5 million) that can be reallocated to the business.\n\nThe company, which also provides hearing tests from thousands of retail outlets, plans to migrate to the cloud and upgrade or move to a new platform over the next four years.\n\nThe company estimates that by moving off Oracle support for its E-Business Suite (EBS) ERP v12.2 systems and onto third-party support from Spinnaker Support, it will save £5 million over the next three years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSpecsavers was founded in the UK in the 1980s and is a household name in its home market, but it has grown internationally through acquisition and expansion. Fourteen years ago, it began an ERP project to standardize on Oracle EBS internationally, but found the project did not meet the challenges of the business along with constant change. In 2021, for example, Specsavers established a presence in North America with the purchase of Canada\'s Image Optometry.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSpecsavers also uses a partnership model, akin to a franchise, in which clinical and retail partners own shares in outlets that are separate legal entities from the main business. Kieran Mazur, head of IT, group, people, and organization, told The Register that the entrepreneurial nature of the business and its rapid expansion put the brakes on ERP standardization.\n\n"That made putting ERP-like applications very difficult, because you\'re starting to go in against the organization\'s culture. So, 14 years of trying to deploy ERPs is quite hard when you don\'t get a level of buy-in to global templates," he said.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSpecsavers might have spent another five years trying to roll out a standard EBS system across all its operations and "nobody in 2030 should be rolling out on-prem ERPs," Mazur added.\n\nThe second reason for pausing the project is that in its lifetime, customer requirements have changed. The company argues that savings made from changing the ERP support model can be plowed back into the business to invest in its retail operations. Interacting with customers on mobile apps, online, and in store also has implications for its operations and supply chain management, which will affect future decisions on its choice and configuration of ERP.\n\n- SAP legacy ERP customers still in no rush to adopt latest platform\n- City council rejects inquiry into £130M Oracle IT disaster\n- It\'s been 20 years since Oracle bought two software rivals, changing the market forever\n- UK council still hadn\'t fully costed troubled Oracle project 2 years in\n\nAs such, Oracle EBS will be locked into its current configuration and the business will minimize investment in running the stack while it makes a longer-term decision, Mazur said.\n\nWhile the company\'s HR application needs are taken care of by SAP\'s SuccessFactors, it is considering its options among vendors of ERP and supply chain management software.\n\n"We\'ve had the show-and-tells from Workday, SAP, Microsoft, Oracle, and Infor, and we\'re going to spend the next six months really getting to an RFP that we think can tell us which vendor and which partner we want to go with to replace some of our biggest ERPs," he said.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAlthough Oracle dominates the landscape, Specsavers also relies on Microsoft Dynamics and other smaller vendors for some of its ERP systems. Mazur said that after commercial negotiations, he expects delivery to start in February next year, giving the company three years to adopt a new ERP system in its biggest markets.\n\nThe two largest ERP vendors both offer customers an upgrade path from legacy software to completely new systems requiring new business processes, S/4HANA for SAP and Fusion for Oracle. Specsavers is unlikely to be the only business to use third-party support to focus on its best options for the future. ®\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#### More about\n\n- Enterprise\n- ERP\n- Oracle\n\nMore like these\n\n×\n\n### More about\n\n- Enterprise\n- ERP\n- Oracle\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n- Database\n- Mark Hurd\n- MySQL\n- Rimini Street\n\n### Broader topics\n\n- Larry Ellison\n- SAP\n\n#### More about\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#### More about\n\n- Enterprise\n- ERP\n- Oracle\n\nMore like these\n\n×\n\n### More about\n\n- Enterprise\n- ERP\n- Oracle\n\n### Narrower topics\n\n- Database\n- Mark Hurd\n- MySQL\n- Rimini Street\n\n### Broader topics\n\n- Larry Ellison\n- SAP\n\n#### TIP US OFF\n\nSend us news\n\n### Other stories you might like\n\n#### Interest in SAP cloud migration triples in its biz heartland\n\nUser group chairman warns, however, that ERP giant\'s pace is not feasible for every org\n\n#### Oracle Cloud security SNAFU latest: IT giant accused of pedantry as evidence scrubbed\n\n1990s incident response in 2025\n\n#### City council rejects inquiry into £130M Oracle IT disaster\n\nOpposition faults leadership as officers accused of misleading councillors\n\n#### Data deluge pushes financial services deeper into AI\n\nHarnessing AI to optimize applications and services is crucial but building the infrastructure is equally important\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#### Oracle JDK 24 appears in rare alignment of version and feature count\n\nThe 24 JDK Enhancement Proposals in Java 24 represent a stochastic sign\n\n#### Brit supermarket finds breaking up is hard to do as Walmart-Asda divorce stretches into fourth year\n\n\'Three-year\' tech support deal still running\n\n#### Europe\'s largest council kept auditors in the dark on Oracle rollout fiasco for 10 months\n\nIt took a whistleblower to expose disastrous ERP go-live\n\n#### Oracle\'s masterclass in breach comms: Deny, deflect, repeat\n\nFallout shows how what you say must be central to disaster planning\n\n#### Oracle Cloud says it\'s not true someone broke into its login servers and stole data\n\nDespite evidence to the contrary as alleged pilfered info goes on sale\n\n#### There are 10,000 reasons to doubt Oracle Cloud\'s security breach denial\n\nCustomers come forward claiming info was swiped from prod\n\n#### Oracle faces Texas-sized lawsuit over alleged cloud snafu and radio silence\n\nVictims expect to spend considerable time and money over privacy incident, lawyers argue\n\n#### Big Red, Microsoft roll out Azure database services for more mainstream Oracle users\n\nEnterprise Edition to be offered on OCI inside Redmond\'s cloud\n\nThe Register   Biting the hand that feeds IT\n\n#### About Us\n\n- Contact us\n- Advertise with us\n- Who we are\n\n#### Our Websites\n\n- The Next Platform\n- DevClass\n- Blocks and Files\n\n#### Your Privacy\n\n- Cookies Policy\n- Privacy Policy\n- Ts &amp; Cs\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCopyright.

Smucker Co., Fresh Roasted Coffee &amp; More\n\nApril 02, 2025 04:38 ET\n\n\n\xa0| Source:\r\n            \nResearch and Markets\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch and Markets\n\nDublin, April  02, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "United States Coffee Market Report Size and Share Analysis - Growth Trends and Forecast Report 2025-2033" has been added to  ResearchAndMarkets.com\'s offering.\n\nThe market size of coffee in the United States is forecast to hit US$ 38.76 billion in 2033 from US$ 27.95 billion in 2024 at a CAGR rate of 3.70% from 2025-2033.\n\nConsumer demand for special coffee, surging demand for premium and organic coffee blends by consumers, as well as enhancing cafe culture are some major reasons behind market growth, coupled with advancements in ready-to-drink and green coffee products.\n\nKey Company Analysis: Overview, Recent Developments &amp; Strategies, Product Portfolio &amp; Product Launches Over the Last Year, Revenue\n\n- Nestle SA\n- Eight O\' Clock Coffee Company\n- Kraft Heinz Co.\n- The J.M. Smucker Co.\n- Fresh Roasted Coffee LLC\n- Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.\n- White Wave Food Co.\n- Monster Beverage Corporation\n- Califia Farms LLC\n- Starbucks Corporation\n\nIncreasing Demand for Specialty and Premium Coffee\n\nThe increased demand for specialty coffee has played a huge role in driving the U.S. coffee market. Customers increasingly demand single-origin, organic, and ethically sourced coffee, which drives premium product demand. Specialty coffee shops and independent coffee houses focus on artisanal coffee-making techniques like pour-over and cold brew, targeting a niche but growing clientele. Third-wave coffee culture with an emphasis on sustainability and traceability is picking up pace, driving brands to spend on new-age blends and specialty roasting styles.\n\nThis trend has driven market growth and premiumization in the coffee sector. October 2024, Minneapolis-based Peace Coffee is introducing an Organic and Fair-Trade Premium Concentrate for cold espresso-based beverages. This shelf-stable, ready-to-use concentrate, crafted with sustainably grown Yeti Blend beans, is offered for food service and wholesale customers.\n\nReady-to-Drink (RTD) and Cold Brew Coffee Growth\n\nReady-to-drink (RTD) and cold brew coffee segments are growing at a quick pace as consumers look for easy and refreshing alternatives to the traditional hot cup of coffee. Owing to busy schedules and ever-increasing demand for on-the-move beverages, RTD coffee, in the form of canned cold brews and bottled lattes, has been a huge hit. Retailers and major coffee brands constantly roll out low-sugar, plant-based, and functional coffee beverages for health-driven consumers.\n\nNew flavors and increasing distribution in supermarkets, convenience stores, and online channels further drive this segment\'s growth. Sept. 2024, Nestle\'s Nespresso is introducing its first ready-to-drink offering, the Master Origins Colombia Coffee, as part of a pilot initiative. This limited-release drink, sold only in the U.S., is brewed with Colombian coffee beans and honey sweetened.\n\nExpansion of E-Commerce and Online Coffee Sales\n\nE-commerce and direct-to-consumer (DTC) sales have changed the U.S. coffee market. Consumers buy more coffee online because of the convenience, choice, and subscription-based offerings on digital platforms. Coffee companies use personalized suggestions, special blends, and home delivery to build customer loyalty. Subscription coffee services, including Blue Bottle and Trade Coffee, offer consumers curated offerings and freshly roasted coffee beans delivered right to their doorstep.\n\nMoreover, the presence of specialty coffee gear, including grinders and espresso machines, has prompted more home brewing, and thus more online coffee consumption. March 2024, Vietnamese robusta brand Nguyen Coffee Supply has become available for delivery everywhere in the US through a partnership with Gopuff. The New York company will see its products shipped out from 500 fulfillment centers across the country.\n\nVolatility in Coffee Bean Prices and Supply Chain Instability\n\nThe U.S. coffee industry is also confronted with severe challenges presented by volatile coffee bean prices in the wake of worldwide supply chain disruptions, global warming, and geopolitics. Climatic changes like drought and frost in leading coffee-producing nations such as Brazil, Colombia, and Vietnam influence production and bring about price uncertainty.\n\nMoreover, rising transportation rates and logistical hassles have contributed to higher costs for importers and roasters. These considerations influence profit margins, and companies must either absorb increased costs or transfer them to consumers, potentially affecting total demand.\n\nRising Competition from Other Beverages\n\nThe trend toward health-oriented and functional drinks threatens the conventional coffee market. Consumers are increasingly turning to matcha, herbal teas, plant-based energy drinks, and kombucha, which provide perceived health benefits and reduced caffeine levels. Also, the increased popularity of nootropic and adaptogenic drinks charged with ingredients such as mushrooms and CBD is increasing, diverting some coffee customers.\n\nTo be competitive, coffee companies need to keep innovating and providing functional coffee products, including those which are vitamin fortified, probiotic fortified, or plant-based.\n\nUnited States Whole Bean Coffee Market\n\nWhole-bean coffee is still favored by coffee aficionados who like to grind their beans for optimal freshness and taste. Home brewing culture growth fuels this segment as consumers spend money on grinders, espresso machines, and pour-over equipment. Specialty coffee roasters and brands provide single-origin and organic whole-bean options, appealing to high-end coffee consumers. Supermarkets, online stores, and direct-to-consumer sites give varied choices, opening up market accessibility.\n\nThe need for sustainable and ethically produced coffee has also driven brands to emphasize fair-trade and shade-grown coffee, supporting the whole-bean coffee industry. February 2024, Cherry Coffee is a West Magnolia Avenue shop that sells five whole-bean roasted coffees. The firm is venturing into the wholesale arena, after purchasing Dallas-based Novel Coffee Roasters a decade ago, bringing with it its business and equipment to Fort Worth.\n\nUnited States Instant Coffee Market\n\nThe US instant coffee industry continues to move forward, as premium and specialty brands are providing more high-end, freeze-dried varieties. Historically favored for its ease and price, instant coffee has experienced revived interest as companies enhance taste profiles and packaging. People who want fast, hassle-free coffee solutions are attracted to single-serve packets and soluble coffee powders.\n\nIncreased demand for organic and specialty instant coffee, especially among millennials and workers in offices, has further grown this segment. In addition, instant coffee is becoming popular in the functional beverage category, with versions containing collagen, adaptogens, and MCT oil. Oct. 2024, Civilized Coffee is thrilled to introduce their new Instant Mocha Powders, offering a quick cafe-quality drink at home.\n\nUnited States Supermarkets/Hypermarkets Coffee Market\n\nSupermarkets and hypermarkets continue to be leading distribution channels for coffee, with a broad range of brands and price points. Customers like to purchase coffee in bulk, taking advantage of discounts and offers at large retail outlets such as Walmart, Costco, and Kroger.\n\nSupermarkets target both mainstream and specialty coffee consumers by carrying anything from ground coffee and instant coffee to organic and specialty whole beans. Large retailers\' offer of private-label coffee brands has further boosted competition. Also, ready-to-drink (RTD) coffee drinks have captured shelf space, signifying the increasing need for convenience coffee offerings.\n\nUnited States Online Retail Coffee Market\n\nThe online retail coffee market is broadening at a quickening pace as a result of digitalization and evolving purchaser purchasing behavior. E-commerce sites such as Amazon, Starbucks, and direct-to-consumer coffee roasters offer subscription options, single-origin offerings, and doorstep delivery.\n\nOnline purchasing of coffee through specialty and newly roasted beans appeals to consumers as a convenience option. Brands engage social media promotion, influencer partnerships, and artificial intelligence suggestions to build brand interaction. Consumers also invest in home brewing hardware, driving more sales online. Sustainable, fair-trade, and customized coffee varieties are also leading the growth in the industry.\n\nKey Attributes\n\n| Report Attribute                      | Details        |\n|---------------------------------------|----------------|\n| No. of Pages                          | 200            |\n| Forecast Period                       | 2024-2033      |\n| Estimated Market Value (USD) in 2024  | $27.95 Billion |\n| Forecasted Market Value (USD) by 2033 | $38.76 Billion |\n| Compound Annual Growth Rate           | 3.7%           |\n| Regions Covered                       | United States  |\n\nKey Topics Covered\n\n1.

They help to ensure that the water is safe for drinking, cooking, and industrial application by removing contaminants from water available to the user such as bacteria, heavy metals, and other impurities.\n\nThe awareness regarding the health risks related to contaminated and polluted water is growing, along with the increasing waterborne diseases are augmenting the demand for filtration solutions in residential, commercial, and industrial applications.\n\nEven in many developing regions where municipal water treatment infrastructure is lacking, the combined impact of widespread adoption of home filtration systems against a backdrop of rapidly growing industrialization and urban expansion has created a strong and pressing demand for effective filtration technologies.\n\nMeanwhile, in developed territories, highly regulated water quality and excellent municipal filtration technology provide high-standard tap water, which in turn causes consumers to see less need to purchase an additional household filtration product.\n\nAs an illustration, more than 98% of the population of the European Union has access to safe drinking water, while the Public Utilities Board in Singapore provides potable tap water at the source, which subsequently curtails the water filtration market for homes in certain areas.\n\nDespite these challenges, the growing consumer preference for more long-term solutions, some environmental sustainability trends in industries, and the advancement of technologies concerning filtration systems still lead to good market opportunities.\n\nA rise in awareness associated with the effect of impurities in drinking water drives the water filtration systems market. Water is one of the basic requirements for survival, due to which demand for clean drinking water has increased over time. The growing issues of water pollution from industrial discharge, agricultural runoff, and aging infrastructure are at the forefront of increasing public awareness regarding water safety, which is making consumers and businesses more willing to pay for dependable purification solutions.\n\nSafe drinking water is crucial, and hence, governments and public health organizations worldwide focus on this aspect and promote water purification technologies for the benefit of people.\n\nRequest a Customized Copy of\xa0the Water Filtration Systems Market\xa0Report @ https://www.custommarketinsights.com/request-for-customization/?reportid=68304\n\nHigh-quality filtration systems are recognized as critical in commercial and industrial settings; the food &amp; beverage, healthcare, and pharmaceutical sectors rely on high-quality filtration to meet regulatory standards and maintain the integrity of products.\n\nThe awareness regarding the various filtration technologies and advantages of different technologies over the others among consumers in some of the regions is an issue that also hampers the penetration in this market.\n\nHowever,\u2002the market is undergoing a transformative change with the transition to sustainable and environmentally friendly filtration solutions, and this represents a fruitful opportunity for manufacturers. As consumers and businesses demand that the products they\u2002buy be more environmentally responsible, filtration solutions that feature components made from renewable materials and recyclable or biodegradable filters are increasingly available.\n\nFor example, businesses like\u2002Blupura are leading the way in this, using renewable materials and energy-efficient processes to develop systems that purify drinking water that meets global sustainability standards. Moreover, they have been installing water refill\u2002stations with high-quality filtration systems to reduce bottled water consumption and plastic waste and support environmental sustainability. Sustainability-oriented innovations are being adopted in residential and commercial markets\u2002alike, bolstering the commitment to sustainability across market segments.\n\nThe use of nanotechnology in water filtration systems is another revolutionary\u2002trend influencing the market. Nanomaterials-based graphene oxide membranes\u2002and carbon nanotubes have the advantageous characteristics of purifying from contamination at the molecular level. These nanofilters coated with graphene have shown very high filtration efficiency, enabling effective removal of heavy metals, bacteria,\u2002and viruses with high water permeation rates.\n\nBased on application, the global water filtration systems market is segmented by family, office, school, and public space.\xa0 Due to rising awareness regarding water quality and health, the residential segment holds the largest share in consumption in the global water filtration systems market. Places of urban population development and industrialization are perfect focal points\u2002for the contamination of water as a resource; water purification is now a common pastime for the world’s households. As consumers have\u2002become increasingly aware of the quality of their drinking water, the demand for home water filtration systems has grown along with it.\n\nThe water filtration systems market is segmented across Asia Pacific, North America, Latin America, Europe, and the Middle East &amp; Africa. The market in the Asia-Pacific region is the\u2002fastest-growing market owing to the rapid industrialization, expanding population, and growing concerns regarding water contamination.\n\nBecause of the lack of municipal water treatment infrastructure and the high levels of\u2002contamination of water sources, there is a high demand for water filtration systems in countries like India and China. These factors are further fueling the growth of the market in the region along with growing consumer awareness and increasing government initiatives towards clean\u2002water accessibility.\n\nThe markets in North America and Europe are relatively\u2002mature but continue to have a healthy demand generation largely for commercial and industrial applications. With many big players present in the market and tight water quality regulations, continuous innovations and adoption of technologies are\u2002imperative. On the other hand, the Middle East &amp; Africa is a potential growth\u2002region due to water scarcity problems and rising expenditure for water treatment infrastructure, which needs efficient filtration solutions.\n\nReport Scope\n\n| Feature of the Report         | Details                                                                                                     |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Market Size in 2025           | USD 14.23 Billion                                                                                           |\n| Projected Market Size in 2034 | USD 35.18 Billion                                                                                           |\n| Market Size in 2024           | USD 14.06 Billion                                                                                           |\n| CAGR Growth Rate              | 9.61% CAGR                                                                                                  |\n| Base Year                     | 2024                                                                                                        |\n| Forecast Period               | 2025-2034                                                                                                   |\n| Key Segment                   | By Product Type, Application and Region                                                                     |\n| Report Coverage               | Revenue Estimation and Forecast, Company   Profile, Competitive Landscape, Growth Factors and Recent Trends |\n| Regional Scope                | North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Middle   East & Africa, and South & Central America                    |\n| Buying Options                | Request tailored purchasing options to   fulfil your requirements for research.                             |\n\n(A free sample of the Water Filtration Systems report is available upon request; please contact us for more information.)\n\nOur Free Sample Report Consists of the following:\n\n- Introduction,      Overview, and in-depth industry analysis are all included in the 2024      updated report.\n- The      COVID-19 Pandemic Outbreak Impact Analysis is included in the package.\n- About      220+ Pages Research Report (Including Recent Research)\n- Provide      detailed chapter-by-chapter guidance on the Request.\n- Updated      Regional Analysis with a Graphical Representation of Size, Share, and      Trends for the Year 2025\n- Includes      Tables and figures have been updated.\n- The      most recent version of the report includes the Top Market Players, their      Business Strategies, Sales Volume, and Revenue Analysis\n- Custom      Market Insights (CMI) research methodology\n\n(Please note that the sample of the Water Filtration Systems report has been modified to include the COVID-19 impact study prior to delivery.)\n\nRequest a Customized Copy of\xa0the Water Filtration Systems Market\xa0Report @ https://www.custommarketinsights.com/report/water-filtration-systems-market/\n\nCMI\xa0has comprehensively analyzed the Global\xa0Water Filtration Systems market.

From March 17 to 26, activity surged with nearly 20,000 IPs scanning logins daily. GreyNoise identified around 23,000 suspicious IPs and 150 known malicious ones, suggesting a potential targeted attack.\n\n“GreyNoise has observed a significant surge in login scanning activity targeting Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS GlobalProtect portals. Over the last 30 days,\xa0nearly 24,000 unique IP addresses have attempted to access these portals.” reads the report published by GreyNoise.\xa0“The pattern suggests a coordinated effort to probe network defenses and identify exposed or vulnerable systems, potentially as a precursor to targeted exploitation.”\n\nThe experts believe that this activity is part of a reconnaissance effort to test network defenses, potentially paving the way for future attacks.\xa0GreyNoise recommends that organizations using Palo Alto Networks products should take steps to secure their login portals.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA large portion of traffic is linked to 3xK Tech GmbH (20,010 IPs) under ASN200373, with contributions from PureVoltage Hosting Inc., Fast Servers Pty Ltd., and Oy Crea Nova Hosting. GreyNoise identified three JA4h hashes related to a login scanner tool. The activity originates mainly from the U.S. (16,249 IPs) and Canada (5,823 IPs), targeting primarily the U.S. (23,768), followed by the U.K., Ireland, Russia, and Singapore.\n\nThe researchers also observed scans that are targeting GlobalProtect portals and other PAN-OS appliances like PAN-OS Crawler, similar to threats identified by Cisco Talos in April last year, which targeted Cisco appliances, Microsoft Exchange servers, and edge devices from various vendors.\n\n“Given the unusual nature of this activity, organizations with exposed Palo Alto Networks systems should review their March logs and\xa0consider performing a detailed threat hunt on running systems to identify any signs of compromise.” GreyNoise concludes.\n\nFollow me on Twitter:\xa0@securityaffairs\xa0and\xa0Facebook\xa0and\xa0Mastodon\n\nPierluigi\xa0Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs\xa0–\xa0hacking,\xa0GreyNoise)\n\n#### you might also like\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n##### New Triada Trojan comes preinstalled on Android devices\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n##### New advanced FIN7\'s Anubis backdoor allows to gain full system control on Windows\n\n#### leave a comment\n\n#### newsletter\n\n###### Subscribe to my email list and stay\n up-to-date!\n\n#### recent articles\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n###### New Triada Trojan comes preinstalled on Android devices\n\nMalware / April 03, 2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n###### New advanced FIN7\'s Anubis backdoor allows to gain full system control on Windows\n\nMalware / April 02, 2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n###### U.S. CISA adds Apache Tomcat flaw to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog\n\nSecurity / April 02, 2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n###### Apple backported fixes for three actively exploited flaws to older devices\n\nSecurity / April 02, 2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n###### Spike in Palo Alto Networks scanner activity suggests imminent cyber threats\n\nHacking / April 02, 2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo contact me write an email to:\n\n\n                            Pierluigi Paganini : \n\n[email\xa0protected]\n\n#### QUICK LINKS\n\n- Home\n- Cyber Crime\n- Cyber warfare\n- APT\n- Data Breach\n- Deep Web\n- Digital ID\n- Hacking\n- Hacktivism\n- Intelligence\n- Internet of Things\n- Laws and regulations\n- Malware\n- Mobile\n- Reports\n- Security\n- Social Networks\n- Terrorism\n- ICS-SCADA\n- POLICIES\n- Contact me\n\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2024\n\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

That has always been on the anvil and now that we are emboldened with better performance this year, we are more than happy to evaluate good companies that will help us with our growth plans," Malhotra said.\n\nRoom for growthMarket intelligence provider Statista estimates that the ready-to-eat segment is expected to expand at a CAGR of 13.41% to $2.13 billion over the next four years. In November, Fireside and Thinking Forks Consulting said in a joint report that urban consumers are eating more frequently through the day but in controlled portions and opting for cooking aids such as ready-to-eat and ready-to-cook products.\n\n     \n      Founded in 1956 by S.P. Malhotra and B.R. Malhotra, Pune-based Weikfield started with the idea of bringing global cuisines to India and introduced custard, cornflour and baking powder. It later diversified to jelly, mustard powder, and drinking chocolate and entered the breakfast segment with oats.\n\nAlso Read | Spices down, sweets up. How Indian ready-to-eat is storming western palates“Weikfield is one of the older brands in the ready-to-eat market and can surely ride the demand growth curve," said Devangshu Dutta, chief executive of consulting firm Third Eyesight. “It did lose its head-start advantage to more recent entrants that have been more aggressive in investing in marketing and distribution. However, the market is far from being saturated, and growth could come from new product and even new brand launches, and perhaps even inorganically through acquisitions."\n\n     \n      He added that growth in the ready-to-cook and ready-to-eat market is fuelled by changing lifestyles that are boosting convenience-led demand, and the growth of brands and products on the supply side, supported by modern retail channels heightening the visibility of the category.\n\n     \n      Weikfield plans to extend its range across its categories with new product offerings and flavours. It operates in five segments - desert mixes such as custard, jelly and faluda, baking products including baking soda, and beverages such as green tea and hot chocolate. It also has a diverse pasta range and condiments including Chinese sauces and ketchup.\n\n     \n      Beyond the expansion plans, Weikfield is evaluating a public listing in the next three years, Malhotra said.\n\n     \n      “We are looking at the IPO market and based on the valuations, we are looking to go public by 2028. The listing will give us a platform to partly cash out as we have been invested in the company for a long time and it will also enable us to raise funds for the company’s future expansion plans," Malhotra said.\n\n     \n      Weikfield has rebuffed several offers for external funding from private equity firms. However, Malhotra envisages that “there will be a fairly decent amount of funding required for supply chain and marketing" going forward, which it plans to raise through the initial public offering.\n\n     \n      “Even for distribution, we will need a different approach because our current distributors are used to long shelf-life products, but the demand is tending towards 30-60-day shelf-life products. That is where we need to reinvent ourselves and will require capital," he said, adding that the company will fund these plans through internal accruals in the run-up to the IPO.\n\nConsolidating exportsThe company has three brands – Weikfield for indulgent and taste-oriented products, Eco Valley for healthy products such as organic green tea, and Chef’s Basket for pasta and other baking items.\n\n     \n      It has three manufacturing facilities – two in Pune and one in Himachal Pradesh. One of the Pune factories supplies the southern and western markets, while the Himachal factory caters to the north and east. The other Pune facility manufactures mushrooms.\n\n     \n      Weikfield gets about 10% of its over  ₹300 crore revenue from exports to the Middle East, Europe, the US, the UK and Africa.\n\n     \n      “We now want to consolidate our presence and sell more of our products in select countries rather than spread ourselves too thin across the world. We\'d rather just focus on where we are present today and continue expanding our sales there," Malhotra said.\n\nAlso Read | Young consumers spark rise of eco-friendly home, personal care products made by startupsUnlike companies that posted plummeting sales during the pandemic, Weikfield was among the few that managed to buck the trend as consumers, bound by lockdown restrictions, were indulgent and increasingly turned to baking and cooking.\n\n     \n      However, as customers returned to their pre-pandemic lifestyles, Weikfield’s sales declined, and it couldn’t sustain the growth trajectory. During this period, the company spent a significant amount of money on marketing and advertising.\n\n     \n      It has since recovered after it focused on profitability and consolidated its presence across geographies and specific products.\n\n     \n      Weikfield is poised to benefit from experienced promoters in the field of food processing, an established brand image and distribution network and vast product assortment, Care Ratings said in a report last year.\n\nQuick commerceOver the past year, the company tied up with quick commerce giants Zepto and Instamart after debuting on Amazon Fresh. E-commerce is one of the company’s fastest-growing channels and it leverages the same distributors for quick commerce to help save costs.\n\nAlso Read | Smaller consumer brands jazz up pitches in scramble to get listed on quick commerce platforms“We have 800 distributors across the country. Wherever these q-com companies have set up dark stores, we have either our distributors or our own depots to service our orders," Malhotra explained, adding that the company has about 28 depots across India.\n\n     \n      The company revenue increased to  ₹315.9 crore in FY24 from  ₹295.3 crore a year earlier. Its profit narrowed to  ₹1.2 crore from  ₹2.2 crore, according to data from Tracxn.\n\n     \n      The company’s revenue increased by 18-20% in FY25, while profit almost tripled, Malhotra said.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCatch all the  and Updates on Live Mint.\n        Download The  to get Daily  &amp; Live .\n\n### topics\n\n- #Consumer sector\n\nShare Via\n\n### MINT SPECIALS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntrending stories\n\nData Pages\n\npopular stocks\n\nlatest stories\n\nNifty 50 Companies\n\nDOWNLOAD APP\n\nDownload the Mint app and read premium stories\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- About Us\n- Contact Us\n- Terms Of Use\n- Privacy Policy\n- RSS\n\nCopyright © 2025 HT Digital Streams Ltd All Right Reserved\n\n#### Wait for it…\n\nLog in to our website to save your bookmarks.

The company sources beans from three suppliers, roasts them at two facilities into either dark or light coffee, and then ships the roasted coffee to three retail locations. The suppliers have different fixed capacity, and roasting costs and shipping costs vary from place to place.\n\nThe company seeks to minimize costs while meeting a 23 percent increase in demand.\n\nWouldn’t it be easier for the company to just ask ChatGPT to come up with an optimal plan? In fact, for all their incredible capabilities, large language models (LLMs) often perform poorly when tasked with directly solving such complicated planning problems on their own.\n\nRather than trying to change the model to make an LLM a better planner, MIT researchers took a different approach. They introduced a framework that guides an LLM to break down the problem like a human would, and then automatically solve it using a powerful software tool.\n\nA user only needs to describe the problem in natural language — no task-specific examples are needed to train or prompt the LLM. The model encodes a user’s text prompt into a format that can be unraveled by\xa0an optimization solver designed to efficiently crack extremely tough planning challenges.\n\nDuring the formulation process, the LLM checks its work at multiple intermediate steps to make sure the plan is described correctly to the solver.\xa0If it spots an error, rather than giving up, the LLM tries to fix the broken part of the formulation.\n\nWhen the researchers tested their framework on nine complex challenges, such as minimizing the distance warehouse robots must travel to complete tasks, it achieved an 85 percent success rate, whereas the best baseline only achieved a 39 percent success rate.\n\nThe versatile framework could be applied to a range of multistep planning tasks, such as scheduling airline crews or managing machine time in a factory.\n\n“Our research introduces a framework that essentially acts as a smart assistant for planning problems. It can figure out the best plan that meets all the needs you have, even if the rules are complicated or unusual,” says Yilun Hao, a graduate student in the MIT Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS) and lead author of a paper on this research.\n\nShe is joined on the paper by Yang Zhang, a research scientist at the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab; and senior author Chuchu Fan, an associate professor of aeronautics and astronautics and LIDS principal investigator. The research will be presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations.\n\nOptimization 101\n\nThe Fan group develops algorithms that automatically solve what are known as combinatorial optimization problems. These vast problems have many interrelated decision variables, each with multiple options that rapidly add up to billions of potential choices.\n\nHumans solve such problems by narrowing them down to a few options and then determining which one leads to the best overall plan. The researchers’ algorithmic solvers apply the same principles to optimization problems that are far too complex for a human to crack.\n\nBut the solvers they develop tend to have steep learning curves and are typically only used by experts.\n\n“We thought that LLMs could allow nonexperts to use these solving algorithms. In our lab, we take a domain expert’s problem and formalize it into a problem our solver can solve. Could we teach an LLM to do the same thing?” Fan says.\n\nUsing the framework the researchers developed, called LLM-Based Formalized Programming (LLMFP), a person provides a natural language description of the problem, background information on the task, and a query that describes their goal.\n\nThen LLMFP prompts an LLM to reason about the problem and determine the decision variables and key constraints that will shape the optimal solution.\n\nLLMFP asks the LLM to detail the requirements of each variable before encoding the information into a mathematical formulation of an optimization problem. It writes code that encodes the problem and calls the attached optimization solver, which arrives at an ideal solution.\n\n“It is similar to how we teach undergrads about optimization problems at MIT. We don’t teach them just one domain. We teach them the methodology,” Fan adds.\n\nAs long as the inputs to the solver are correct, it will give the right answer. Any mistakes in the solution come from errors in the formulation process.\n\nTo ensure it has found a working plan, LLMFP analyzes the solution and modifies any incorrect steps in the problem formulation. Once the plan passes this self-assessment, the solution is described to the user in natural language.\n\nPerfecting the plan\n\nThis self-assessment module also allows the LLM to add any implicit constraints it missed the first time around, Hao says.\n\nFor instance, if the framework is optimizing a supply chain to minimize costs for a coffeeshop, a human knows the coffeeshop can’t ship a negative amount of roasted beans, but an LLM might not realize that.\n\nThe self-assessment step would flag that error and prompt the model to fix it.\n\n“Plus, an LLM can adapt to the preferences of the user. If the model realizes a particular user does not like to change the time or budget of their travel plans, it can suggest changing things that fit the user’s needs,” Fan says.\n\nIn a series of tests, their framework achieved an average success rate between 83 and 87 percent across nine diverse planning problems using several LLMs. While some baseline models were better at certain problems, LLMFP achieved an overall success rate about twice as high as the baseline techniques.\n\nUnlike these other approaches, LLMFP does not require domain-specific examples for training. It can find the optimal solution to a planning problem right out of the box.\n\nIn addition, the user can adapt LLMFP for different optimization solvers by adjusting the prompts fed to the LLM.\n\n“With LLMs, we have an opportunity to create an interface that allows people to use tools from other domains to solve problems in ways they might not have been thinking about before,” Fan says.\n\nIn the future, the researchers want to enable LLMFP to take images as input to supplement the descriptions of a planning problem.

Our Delta Facility is fully operational and has annual production capacity of 11,000 kg. We are continuously evaluating ways to improve both our yield and quality at the Delta Facility and are in the trial stage of evaluating additional lighting at site.\n\nIn order to increase our supply of premium flower, we plan to acquire the Hope Facility that will significantly expand our annual production capacity, adding an annual production capacity of 4,500 kg, representing an over 40% increase over our current annual production capacity from the Delta Facility, bringing total annual production capacity to 15,500 kg of premium cannabis. This acquisition is planned to close in Q2 2025 with certain incremental capital to meet our requirements completed by mid-summer. Pending licensing timing expected sometime in the summer, we expect to be running at full capacity by the end of the year but not contributing to our revenue until 2026. We expect to incur additional debt financing related to the Hope Facility.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nOur 2024 net revenue growth has been driven through strategic partnerships with co-manufacturers and contract growers and these arrangements are expected to provide up to 2,000 kgs of incremental biomass to our business in 2025. We plan to continue to collaborate with our trusted partners and explore additional partnerships as we strive to meet the growing demand for our high-quality premium products.\n\nBuilding Trust with our Customers in Canada\n\nWe are committed to the growing Canadian cannabis market and dedicated to being a trusted partner for our customers—including provincial distributors, retailers, and consumers. As the Canadian customers face increasing competition from international demand, we have seen many mainstream and premium licensed producers shifting their sales abroad. We see this as a prime opportunity to strengthen our brand presence in Canada.\n\nWith SKU rationalization underway across several provinces, suppliers are being evaluated on reliability and sales performance. This shift is raising the bar for market entry, making it increasingly challenging for new brands and products to secure shelf space. At the same time, Canadian consumers are becoming more brand-loyal, prioritizing trust and value in their purchasing decisions. We believe our award-winning brands and diverse product portfolio will continue to resonate with them.\n\nAdvertisement 7\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nLooking ahead, we anticipate a more competitive retail landscape. However, Rubicon’s strong brand recognition, consumer loyalty, high supplier ratings, and strategic positioning provide a solid foundation for long-term success in Canada.\n\nGenetics\n\nWe possess valuable and unique intellectual property in cannabis genetics, which we consider a critical asset in maintaining our position as a leading innovator within the industry. Our extensive genetics library is central to our strategy of delivering consistent, high-quality genetics and new product offerings for the premium and super-premium markets. While we maintain confidentiality around our specific genetics strategy, we view this as a significant competitive advantage and anticipate introducing exciting new genetic launches in 2025.\n\nInternational\n\nOur strong reputation in Canada has attracted an increasing number of inquiries from international medical cannabis buyers. The international cannabis market has experienced significant growth in recent years, with continued expansion anticipated. While the market is still in the early stages of adopting premium cannabis products, we aim to meet small amounts of the international demand with a test and learn strategy in 2025 making sure to meet our Canadian customer needs as a priority. The Company holds the necessary certifications for international exports and made its inaugural international shipment in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nAdvertisement 8\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nFinancial Growth\n\nFor 2025, we are forecasting growth in both net revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, excluding acquisition-related and start up operational costs associated with the Hope Facility (the “Hope Costs”), driven by our ongoing expansion and strategic initiatives. While we anticipate strong performance in 2025, we expect the Hope Costs will impact our overall financial results. Despite the potential short-term impact of the Hope Costs on profitability, we are confident that our continued growth in net revenue and improved like-for-like Adjusted EBITDA will position us for long-term success and value creation.\n\nConference Call\n\nThe Company will be hosting a conference call to discuss Q4 2024 results on Wednesday, April 2, 2025.

The Company plans to use the Hope Facility to expand its production capacity. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2025.\n- The Company’s Delta Facility received its CUMCS Equivalency IMC-G.A.P. certification and executed its first international shipment.\n- 1964 Supply Co™ launched two more FSE resin vapes with LA Kush and Stinky Pinky, bringing the total amount of vapes available to 7.\n\n2025 Outlook\n\nSecuring Additional Premium Quality Supply\n\nWith growing demand for Canadian cannabis from the domestic and international markets, we see that controlling access to premium quality supply is critical to continue to grow our brands and gross revenue. Our Delta Facility is fully operational and has annual production capacity of 11,000 kg. We are continuously evaluating ways to improve both our yield and quality at the Delta Facility and are in the trial stage of evaluating additional lighting at site.\n\nIn order to increase our supply of premium flower, we plan to acquire the Hope Facility that will significantly expand our annual production capacity, adding an annual production capacity of 4,500 kg, representing an over 40% increase over our current annual production capacity from the Delta Facility, bringing total annual production capacity to 15,500 kg of premium cannabis. This acquisition is planned to close in Q2 2025 with certain incremental capital to meet our requirements completed by mid-summer. Pending licensing timing expected sometime in the summer, we expect to be running at full capacity by the end of the year but not contributing to our revenue until 2026. We expect to incur additional debt financing related to the Hope Facility.\n\nOur 2024 net revenue growth has been driven through strategic partnerships with co-manufacturers and contract growers and these arrangements are expected to provide up to 2,000 kgs of incremental biomass to our business in 2025. We plan to continue to collaborate with our trusted partners and explore additional partnerships as we strive to meet the growing demand for our high-quality premium products.\n\nBuilding Trust with our Customers in Canada\n\nWe are committed to the growing Canadian cannabis market and dedicated to being a trusted partner for our customers—including provincial distributors, retailers, and consumers. As the Canadian customers face increasing competition from international demand, we have seen many mainstream and premium licensed producers shifting their sales abroad. We see this as a prime opportunity to strengthen our brand presence in Canada.\n\nWith SKU rationalization underway across several provinces, suppliers are being evaluated on reliability and sales performance. This shift is raising the bar for market entry, making it increasingly challenging for new brands and products to secure shelf space. At the same time, Canadian consumers are becoming more brand-loyal, prioritizing trust and value in their purchasing decisions. We believe our award-winning brands and diverse product portfolio will continue to resonate with them.\n\nLooking ahead, we anticipate a more competitive retail landscape. However, Rubicon’s strong brand recognition, consumer loyalty, high supplier ratings, and strategic positioning provide a solid foundation for long-term success in Canada.\n\nGenetics\n\nWe possess valuable and unique intellectual property in cannabis genetics, which we consider a critical asset in maintaining our position as a leading innovator within the industry. Our extensive genetics library is central to our strategy of delivering consistent, high-quality genetics and new product offerings for the premium and super-premium markets. While we maintain confidentiality around our specific genetics strategy, we view this as a significant competitive advantage and anticipate introducing exciting new genetic launches in 2025.\n\nInternational\n\nOur strong reputation in Canada has attracted an increasing number of inquiries from international medical cannabis buyers. The international cannabis market has experienced significant growth in recent years, with continued expansion anticipated. While the market is still in the early stages of adopting premium cannabis products, we aim to meet small amounts of the international demand with a test and learn strategy in 2025 making sure to meet our Canadian customer needs as a priority. The Company holds the necessary certifications for international exports and made its inaugural international shipment in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nFinancial Growth\n\nFor 2025, we are forecasting growth in both net revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, excluding acquisition-related and start up operational costs associated with the Hope Facility (the “Hope Costs”), driven by our ongoing expansion and strategic initiatives. While we anticipate strong performance in 2025, we expect the Hope Costs will impact our overall financial results. Despite the potential short-term impact of the Hope Costs on profitability, we are confident that our continued growth in net revenue and improved like-for-like Adjusted EBITDA will position us for long-term success and value creation.\n\nConference Call\n\nThe Company will be hosting a conference call to discuss Q4 2024 results on Wednesday, April 2, 2025.

Just recently, a fire at Brazil's Maximus factory left workers hospitalized. In India, a textile unit crumbled, claiming multiple lives. Despite decades of scrutiny, workplace safety remains an afterthought in too many corners of the industry.\n\nBut amidst this grim backdrop, Bangladesh stands out for how dramatically it has changed course.\n\nThe 2013 Rana Plaza disaster was a turning point. In the deadliest garment factory collapse in history, more than 1,100 workers lost their lives. The shock reverberated worldwide, but for Bangladesh, it was a call for action. What followed was a sweeping overhaul of its textiles industry.\n\nToday, Bangladesh is the world's second-largest apparel exporter, not just because of its output but because of the strides it has taken to make manufacturing safer, fairer, and more accountable.\n\nLandmark reforms like the Accord on Fire and Building Safety have upgraded 850 factories and improved conditions for over a million workers, drawing $70 million in brand-backed investments. Alongside it, the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety has inspected hundreds of sites, trained thousands, and driven sweeping safety upgrades.\n\nThe government, too, has stepped up. Labor laws now mandate worker safety committees in all factories with over 50 employees. Unionization, once notoriously difficult, has become more accessible—the number of trade unions has surged from 132 in 2012 to over 1,000 today. A 56% minimum wage hike in 2023 helped improve living standards and boosted purchasing power among garment workers.\n\nRegulatory oversight has also tightened. Stronger regulatory bodies conduct frequent inspections, and the Department of Inspection for Factories and Establishments (DIFE) has been strengthened to conduct regular safety audits, while new labor courts offer workers clearer recourse for unsafe conditions and exploitation.\n\nUnder interim Prime Minister Muhammad Yunus, Bangladesh pledged to align labor laws with international ILO standards, appointing a special envoy to drive legislative reform and respond to long-standing concerns from unions, global labor watchdogs, and Western governments.\n\nThese social and legal reforms have unfolded alongside a technological shift. Smart factories are rapidly adopting automation, AI tools, and Internet of Things (IoT) systems to streamline production and improve working conditions. A 2024 survey noted that 85% of Bangladeshi workers using semi-automated systems experienced reduced physical strain, especially in labor-intensive tasks like knitting and stitching. Error rates dropped by 50%, and 97% of workers stated they hit production targets more easily.\n\nSustainability, once seen as a luxury add-on, is becoming standard practice. Waterless dyeing techniques, laser cutting, and cleaner energy use are reshaping the manufacturing landscape, helping Bangladesh evolve from a low-cost producer to a future-focused, environmentally conscious hub.\n\nThe result? Fewer accidents. Safer workplaces. And crucially, a growing culture where workers are encouraged to speak up about safety concerns. Together, greater accountability and workplace improvements are reshaping how clothes are made—and who gets protected in the process.\n\nAnd the world is noticing.\n\nEven during the global slowdown, textile exports to the U.S. rose to $7.34 billion, while European demand surged to $11.81 billion, led by a 13.47% rise in Germany alone. Other core markets like Spain, France, and the Netherlands also posted strong growth, reflecting sustained European demand for Bangladeshi textiles.\n\nBangladesh's ambitions go far beyond garment exports. A wave of ambitious transformation—including modern airports, expressways, upgraded logistic hubs, and sustainably designed five-star hotels—is reshaping the country into a more connected, investment-ready destination for global fashion brands and retail giants. Outside the cities, modern industrial zones like the Korean Export Processing Zone (KEPZ) in Chattogram showcase the future of eco-friendly manufacturing. Here, leafy avenues merge into green manufacturing facilities that provide healthcare and technical education for workers and their families.\n\nAs Bangladesh gears up to graduate from Least Developed Country (LDC) status in November 2026—a bold step toward its vision of becoming a developed economy by 2041—the textiles sector remains at the heart of its development strategy. The government is pushing for full transparency in the industry: brands sourcing from Bangladesh must now disclose supply chain information, aligning practices with U.S. and EU labor regulations. These reforms are propelling the country toward a more ethical, accountable manufacturing future.\n\nDhaka's labor reforms have earned nods from global institutions like the World Bank, whose B-READY 2024 framework spotlights Bangladesh's advances in labor rights and business environment reform.\n\nThis isn't just recovery—it's reinvention. Bangladesh's journey from the ruins of Rana Plaza to the forefront of ethical manufacturing is a testament to what's possible when tragedy leads to reform and reform leads to lasting change.\n\n© Copyright IBTimes 2024.

The realty sector emerged as the top performer, rallying over 3.35 per cent amid growing expectations of an interest rate cut in the upcoming RBI monetary policy meeting next week. \n“Today, the benchmark indices witnessed a recovery rally, with the Nifty ending 167 points higher, while the Sensex was up by 593 points.

Among sectors, most of the major sectoral indices traded in positive territory, but the Realty index outperformed, rallying over 3.35 percent.Technically, on intraday charts, after a muted opening, the market found support near 23150/76000 and reversed. Following this reversal, it maintained positive momentum throughout the day. Additionally, it formed a bullish candle on daily charts, supporting a further uptrend.We believe that as long as the market is trading above 23150/76000, the pullback formation is likely to continue. On the upside, it could move up to 23500/77000. A dismissal of 23500/77000 could push the market towards 23650/77500. Conversely, if the market falls below 23150/76000, selling pressure may intensify, and it could slip to the 23000-22950/75500-75300 range.- Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities\n- 15:43 | April 2, 2025Stock market live updates: Top gainers &amp; losers on the NSE\n  Top gainers on the NSE:Tata Consumer Products, Zomato, Titan, IndusInd and Tech MahindraTop losers: BEL, Nestle India, UltraTech, Bajaj Finserv, Power Grid\n- 15:40 | April 2, 2025Stock market live today: Mamaearth launches new mosquito repellent campaign with Shilpa Shetty\n  Mamaearth launches new mosquito repellent campaign with Shilpa Shetty\xa0Mamaearth launches new mosquito repellent campaign with Shilpa Shetty Kundra, offering natural protection for children.\n- 15:38 | April 2, 2025Stock market live updates today: Closing bell | Sensex, Nifty ends higher\n  Sensex closed 592.93 points or 0.78% higher at 76,617.44, close to the day’s high of 76,680.35.

But it’s also been reported that a tiered system with different rates or a customised approach is being considered. Expectations are also that some sensitive sectors can be excluded to minimise the impact on US producers and consumers. There is an open question of whether new tariffs will be added to existing ones on autos and metals or if only the highest tariff rate will be in place.\xa0“The second layer of FX impact will depend on the geographical distribution of tariffs. Markets may be taking the 20% flat rate as a baseline, which can generate a stronger dollar reaction across the board, but the details of country-specific and product-specific duties should determine how single currencies will behave in the crosses. We still think European currencies are facing greater downside risks in this sense. Finally, the US administration’s tone on negotiation room will be a key factor for market reaction.“We have seen some sharp outperformance of AUD, NZD, NOK and CAD overnight as a flat tariff as opposed to case-specific reciprocal tariffs is seen as slightly more lenient and crucially less unpredictable. Our view remains that downside risks dominate for all currencies against the dollar today. The US may try to announce the harsher measures today before eventually scaling it back, which may still force a positioning rotation into USD and JPY with high beta currencies taking the bigger hit. But dollar outperformance today will not be indicative of more sustainable strengthening. Time will be needed to assess how long tariffs will remain in place: alongside US data releases (watch ADP payrolls today), that will determine the USD outlook. We still favour USD appreciation beyond today’s event, but it will hardly be a smooth ride.”\n\n15:14 | April 2, 2025Stock market live today: SAR Televenture board approves share swap for acquisition of a majority stake in Tikona Infinet for ₹578 crore\n  SAR Televenture Limited, a leading network infrastructure company listed on NSE, has announced that its Board has approved the share swap for acquisition of a majority stake in Tikona Infinet Limited, a prominent internet service provider, for a total consideration of ₹578 crore.

The BSE Sensex surged 592.93 points or 0.78 per cent to close at 76,617.44, while the NSE Nifty climbed 166.65 points or 0.72 per cent to end at 23,332.35. \nThe market opened flat but gained momentum throughout the day, with buying interest seen across most sectors. The realty sector emerged as the top performer, rallying over 3.35 per cent amid growing expectations of an interest rate cut in the upcoming RBI monetary policy meeting next week. \n“Today, the benchmark indices witnessed a recovery rally, with the Nifty ending 167 points higher, while the Sensex was up by 593 points. Among sectors, most of the major sectoral indices traded in positive territory, but the realty index outperformed, rallying over 3.35 per cent,” said Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities.\n\n### By KS Badri NarayananTeam BL\n\nUpdated - April 02, 2025  at 05:33 PM.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCandle stick graph chart of stock market investment trading, Stock exchange concept design and background.

Among sectors, most of the major sectoral indices traded in positive territory, but the Realty index outperformed, rallying over 3.35 percent.Technically, on intraday charts, after a muted opening, the market found support near 23150/76000 and reversed. Following this reversal, it maintained positive momentum throughout the day. Additionally, it formed a bullish candle on daily charts, supporting a further uptrend.We believe that as long as the market is trading above 23150/76000, the pullback formation is likely to continue. On the upside, it could move up to 23500/77000. A dismissal of 23500/77000 could push the market towards 23650/77500. Conversely, if the market falls below 23150/76000, selling pressure may intensify, and it could slip to the 23000-22950/75500-75300 range.- Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities\n- 15:43 | April 2, 2025Stock market live updates: Top gainers &amp; losers on the NSE\n  Top gainers on the NSE:Tata Consumer Products, Zomato, Titan, IndusInd and Tech MahindraTop losers: BEL, Nestle India, UltraTech, Bajaj Finserv, Power Grid\n- 15:40 | April 2, 2025Stock market live today: Mamaearth launches new mosquito repellent campaign with Shilpa Shetty\n  Mamaearth launches new mosquito repellent campaign with Shilpa Shetty\xa0Mamaearth launches new mosquito repellent campaign with Shilpa Shetty Kundra, offering natural protection for children.\n- 15:38 | April 2, 2025Stock market live updates today: Closing bell | Sensex, Nifty ends higher\n  Sensex closed 592.93 points or 0.78% higher at 76,617.44, close to the day’s high of 76,680.35.

But it’s also been reported that a tiered system with different rates or a customised approach is being considered. Expectations are also that some sensitive sectors can be excluded to minimise the impact on US producers and consumers. There is an open question of whether new tariffs will be added to existing ones on autos and metals or if only the highest tariff rate will be in place.\xa0“The second layer of FX impact will depend on the geographical distribution of tariffs. Markets may be taking the 20% flat rate as a baseline, which can generate a stronger dollar reaction across the board, but the details of country-specific and product-specific duties should determine how single currencies will behave in the crosses. We still think European currencies are facing greater downside risks in this sense. Finally, the US administration’s tone on negotiation room will be a key factor for market reaction.“We have seen some sharp outperformance of AUD, NZD, NOK and CAD overnight as a flat tariff as opposed to case-specific reciprocal tariffs is seen as slightly more lenient and crucially less unpredictable. Our view remains that downside risks dominate for all currencies against the dollar today. The US may try to announce the harsher measures today before eventually scaling it back, which may still force a positioning rotation into USD and JPY with high beta currencies taking the bigger hit. But dollar outperformance today will not be indicative of more sustainable strengthening. Time will be needed to assess how long tariffs will remain in place: alongside US data releases (watch ADP payrolls today), that will determine the USD outlook. We still favour USD appreciation beyond today’s event, but it will hardly be a smooth ride.”\n\n15:14 | April 2, 2025Stock market live today: SAR Televenture board approves share swap for acquisition of a majority stake in Tikona Infinet for ₹578 crore\n  SAR Televenture Limited, a leading network infrastructure company listed on NSE, has announced that its Board has approved the share swap for acquisition of a majority stake in Tikona Infinet Limited, a prominent internet service provider, for a total consideration of ₹578 crore.

This report explores key trends, insights, and future opportunities in this dynamic and rapidly evolving landscape.\n\nWith March Madness in full swing, spectators are seeing some of the top-endorsed Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) athletes earn their stripes on and off the court. That ranges from top-endorsed players like UNC’s RJ Davis and USC’s JuJu Watkins to McNeese State University’s Amir Khan, the first student manager to capture brand endorsement deals. NIL endorsements, which launched in 2021, have experienced significant changes over the past 12 months, but an even more transformative shift may be on the horizon. The House v. NCAA settlement, with a final approval hearing scheduled for April 7, could usher in a new era of revenue-sharing by allowing schools to pay their athletes—and potentially redefine the business of college athletics.\n\n“Brands are getting smarter—and more strategic—about how they approach NIL. Some are going all-in on high-profile athletes to maximize exposure during marquee events like March Madness, while others are placing early bets on under-the-radar talent with big upside,” said Bob Lynch, Founder and CEO of SponsorUnited. “Whether it’s a star player, scout team standout, or student manager, the common thread is that brands are leaning into storytelling, real-time relevance, and the cultural currency these athletes now carry. NIL has evolved from a test-and-learn phase into a core part of the sports marketing playbook.”\n\nKey report findings include:\n\nBasketball players overwhelmingly top endorsement ranks\nFittingly, as the sports world is focused on the Men’s and Women’s NCAA Basketball Tournaments, the majority (seven) of the top 10 most-endorsed college athletes–male and female–are basketball players.\n\nTechnology, Beverage, and Retail brand categories are on the rise\nAs the NIL market continues to grow, certain industry categories are emerging, while others are scaling back. Categories on the rise include technology with over 375 deals, non-alcoholic beverage and retail, each with over 200 deals. Meanwhile, traditionally dominant categories such as Apparel &amp; Accessories, are shifting strategies. Though still holding the largest share of NIL deals (over 470), the category saw a dip in total volume.\n\nCasual, story-driven social posts have highest engagement\nTop-performing social posts within NIL deals thrive on humor, authenticity, and subtle branding, seamlessly integrating CTAs without feeling like ads.\n\nTop brands showcase diverse, attention-grabbing strategies\nWhile many brands are increasing their NIL investments, it’s how they’re activating those deals that stand out. Some of the most notable brand activations from the top 10 brands include those from Raising Cane’s (2nd, 69 deals), Hollister (T-6th, 46), Uber (T-6th, 46), and Nintendo (9th, 35).\n\nView the full report here.\n\nAbout SponsorUnited\nLaunched in 2018, SponsorUnited is the leading global sports and entertainment intelligence platform, delivering actionable data and insights to build stronger marketing partnerships.

In the last three decades, e-commerce has truly changed how we shop, with 20% of global sales occurring on e-commerce platforms, according to McKinsey. With so much of the world having access to the internet, enabling e-commerce is rapidly moving from “nice to do” to “mandatory” for successful businesses.\n\nWhen companies are undergoing geographic expansion, leveraging e-commerce properly can make a meaningful difference in the success of their venture. But before understanding how this can occur, it’s important to understand why.\n\n## Considerations For Consistent Growth\n\nFor a company—especially a public one—consistent growth is expected. There are two ways to achieve this: Selling more to your existing customer base and acquiring new customers to increase revenue.\n\nThe latter is often the easier path. Getting more from your current customers requires deeper marketing investments and product adjustments, while entering a new market provides an opportunity to scale naturally.\n\nBefore e-commerce, expanding into a new market meant opening physical stores, which involved high costs, location selection and logistical challenges. E-commerce removes many of these barriers, making global expansion far more accessible. However, it’s not as simple as just making your website available in another country. You have to consider whether your products are suited to the new market and whether delivering them—through logistical complications, regulatory hurdles and differences in purchasing trends—will be a worthwhile venture.\n\n## Challenges In Market Expansion\n\nRetailers face an array of hurdles when undergoing geographic expansion into a new market. The most significant of these challenges: understanding the customer. Smaller businesses often lack the resources to conduct deep market research, leading to incorrect assumptions—like assuming customers in a new region will behave the same as those in their existing market.\n\nThat’s a common mistake and a recipe for failure. Even within the same country, customers in different cities behave differently. A customer in San Francisco is different from one in New York, and a customer in London differs from one in Birmingham.\n\nTo mitigate this, companies should invest time in upfront research. Spend at least a quarter analyzing the target market: How do customers shop? What payment methods do they prefer? What cultural and behavioral nuances should be considered? Failing to understand these can lead to a product failing in a new market.\n\nAnother overlooked challenge is regulatory compliance. Every country—and sometimes even different regions within a country—has its own regulations. Expanding within the European Union, for example, still comes with country-specific legal requirements. Many companies only address regulations late in the expansion process, which can cause delays or compliance issues. The best approach is to work with strong legal counsel who understands the regulations and can anticipate the necessary approvals.\n\nLogistics are another important consideration. If your current fulfillment model involves shipping from a centralized warehouse, but a competitor provides local delivery in two days, you risk losing customers. Today’s customers expect near-instant gratification. If a competitor delivers in three days while you take five, that’s lost revenue. And beyond shipping speed, you also need to think about returns. If you're selling apparel, for example, returns are common. Making returns simple and low-friction is crucial for retaining customers.\n\n## Keys To Successful Global Expansion\n\nTo tackle these challenges and successfully enter a new market, you need a plan in place. Consider these five steps:\n\n1. Research your customer. Understand how customers shop, what they want and how they interact with brands. Where do they frequent? What are their expectations? While compelling products and retailers pioneering frictionless customer experiences usually drive customer behavioral changes, these changes take time to materialize and are high-risk bets. If you don’t bridge current expectations with your future vision, you risk alienating the market.\n\n2. Understand local payment preferences. Payment behavior varies by region. For instance, in the Middle East, cash usage is high, but digital wallets are also increasingly being adopted. Customers often top up their wallets with cash while grocery shopping, then use those wallets for e-commerce. If your platform only supports credit and debit cards, you’ll restrict access to your products for a major customer segment.\n\n3. Focus on localization and personalization. Your North American website shouldn’t look the same as your U.K. website. Everything from product recommendations to promotions should be tailored to local preferences. For example, July 4th sales are huge in the U.S. but irrelevant in Europe. Similarly, St. Patrick’s Day is a major event in Ireland, but not on the same scale elsewhere.\n\n4. Meet and exceed logistics and delivery expectations. Fast shipping matters, but expectations differ by country. In the U.S., people are used to two-day delivery—or even same-day in some cases. In other regions, five-day delivery might be perfectly acceptable. Companies need to understand, meet and ideally surpass customer expectations, all while balancing cost-effectiveness.\n\n5. Maintain careful regulatory compliance. Expanding into new markets requires a deep understanding of trade regulations, privacy laws and industry-specific requirements. Address these issues early to avoid setbacks.\n\nGetting all of these elements right requires a lot of legwork upfront and continuous observation and adjustment.

Bombay Shirt Company believes that the Indian customer is evolving and it is helping men choose the right fit through a personalised apparel.\n\nChippy Mehta, co-founder and COO, Bombay Shirt Company says that if a customer wants to buy a shirt, he needs to try ten different brands to find the right fit; the right style; full sleeve or half sleeve; with or without pocket and the right fabric. It starts getting very complicated. Men want to enjoy shopping. When they are spending ₹5,000 on a shirt or pants, they want to enjoy that. They don’t want to feel like it’s a torture. “We give that shopping experience to men. We offer personalised in-store shopping experience wherein a customer can choose the fabric for tailor-made shirts and then get it fitted from their inhouse tailors ,” he told businessine.\n\nThe stylist at the stores will help customers pick the fabric that suits his needs and then help him with the right customisation such as the cuffs, the collar and more, thus giving a personalised product. “We sweeten the shopping with the monogram where the customer’s initials are monogrammed in different parts of the shirt depending on what he wants,” said Mehta.\n\nTalking about customisation in the age of quick commerce, Mehta said that the segment offers a lot of potential and the company is watching the space keenly.\n\n## Readymade shirts\n\nThe company’s readymade shirts are priced between ₹2,000 and ₹4,000. Its custom made shirts start at around ₹3,000 and can go up to ₹5000 to ₹6,000. It also has custom-made shirts where fabrics are flown from Italy and these shirts can cost from  ₹30,000 to  ₹80,000 a shirt. Fabrics are sourced from Japan, Italy, from Spain, Portugal, Far East and India, Mehta said.\n\nEvery day, the company ships out 1,000 custom products. “We are growing at around 50 per cent,” Mehta said without giving any financial details.\n\nThe company’s largest way of marketing is by word of mouth. “Our repeat customer base is 70   75 per cent. That’s the most important metric for us because that is what ultimately gets new customers,” he told businessline at the company’s 27th outlet opened in Chennai on Wednesday.\n\nFounded in 2012, Bombay Shirt started as an online custom-made shirt brand and expanded to include ready-to-wear apparel and has 27 stores across India and  one in New York, offering a blend of classic tailoring and modern designs. “We want to close the year with 40 stores,” he said.\n\n“While we have been in the market since 2012, the growth has come only in the last two years,” he said. In February 2024, the company raised ₹54 crore in a Series B funding for expansion.\n\nPublished on  April 2, 2025\n\nTHIS AD SUPPORTS OUR JOURNALISM.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tFOR MINIMAL ADS.\n\nTHIS AD SUPPORTS OUR JOURNALISM.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tFOR MINIMAL ADS.\n\nTHIS AD SUPPORTS OUR JOURNALISM.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tFOR MINIMAL ADS.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n##### The Hindu Businessline\n\n##### Contact us\n\n##### News\n\n##### Group News Sites\n\n##### Calculators\n\n##### Other Products\n\n##### Markets\n\n##### Holidays 2025\n\n##### Popular Sections\n\n##### Popular Stocks\n\n##### Trending on Businessline\n\n##### Trending on Group sites\n\n##### Latest News\n\n- India’s IT sector unfazed by US tariffs, but manufacturing and exports face hurdles, say experts\n- Thomas Cook India taps Kartik Aaryan as brand ambassador for forex business\n- Schaeffler India conducts raids to combat counterfeit products\n- India’s pharma sector spared from US tariff hikes as Wanbury plans investor visit\n- Bollywood to PM Modi: How ChatGPT’s Ghibli trend took India by storm\n\n- Top gainers &amp; losers intraday April 3, 2025: Trump’s tariffs drag market; IT majors TCS, Wipro, Tech Mahindra, Infosys, Coforge plunge\n- Trump tariffs: Indian cashew set to gain in US as Vietnam faces higher duty\n- US trade tariffs weigh on markets; Indian IT stocks hit hardest\n- Finance Ministry scraps fee for updating nominees in PPF accounts\n- ACME Solar secures ₹2,491 crore refinancing for renewable projects\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCopyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Big names such as Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), Gap (GAP), and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch (ANF) have warned about the impact of tariffs this year on profits. In the meantime, shoppers are growing concerned about what they will be paying for spring and summer apparel once tariffs kick in. The reality is that consumers may resist the higher prices, sending retailers off to offer profit-busting discounts and earnings warnings. Luxury goods companies are by no means immune to the challenges as their results have been powered by international shoppers and a wealthy class feasting on strong stock market gains (until now). Is there any reason to be optimistic about the sector? Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi sits down on the Opening Bid podcast with noted fashion designer Rebecca Minkoff for her perspective on the state of retail. Minkoff created her company from the ground floor in the mid-2000s and has seen some of the highest of the highs and lowest of the lows in retail. Minkoff is also the author of the new book Fearless: The New Rules for Unlocking Creativity, Courage, and Success, where she aims to impart leadership wisdom to the next generation of female entrepreneurs.\n\nWelcome to a new episode of Opening Bid. I\'m Yahooy\'s executive editor Brian Sazi. Like I would say, this is the podcast that will make you a better investor and a better leader. I really want to lean into being a better leader here today with our next guest. It is Rebecca Minkoff, uh, fashion designer, entrepreneur, leader, a little bit ofeverything,\n\na little bit of everything, podcaster.\n\nYeah, I\'ve been following your journey for some time. Congrats on this new book, uh, Fearless, the new rules for unlocking creativity, courage and success. What made you write this now?\n\nYou know, I wrote the hardcover in 2021 after we testing my rules during COVID, saying if I have to rebuild my business in the pandemic, let me see if this worked a second time after I started my company.And it was time to release it in paperback, make it more accessible, and we\'re celebrating our 20th anniversary as a brand. It\'s been 20 years, 20 years, so I figured this was perfect timing.\n\nHave you,uh, did yousell the company?\n\nWe sold the company 3 years ago.\n\nYes, that tough to do?\n\nIt was tough only because, you know, it\'s my name. I\'m connected to it, but I\'m there every day. I\'m a very happily paid employee and I, I love, I love the work and I continue to be there no matter what. So take\n\nus inside this book. What are some of the lessons that you\'ve learned.Uh, building your business,\n\nIthink the idea of risk taking, I think so many people are averse to taking risks and the fear that overcomes them, you know, in their gut stops them. And so the goal of this book is that, you know, pulling your hair over your shoulder and saying I\'m fearless. It\'s really about I\'m scared, but here are some things I can hold on to to just take the risk anyways.\n\nWhat did you, uh, you know, as you were or have been building your business, did you make any mistakes along the way?\n\nNone.No, it\'s been so easy. Um, we\'d be here all day. I mean we made risks from early on from not having quality control and having the wrong designers, you know, brand inside my bag so that was, that was a humbling moment we\'ve made risks when it came to using.Tech early on, you know, having a Twitter, a live Twitter feed during my fashion show, not realizing that when you start trending on Twitter as it was called back in the day, that maybe some inappropriate things are shown to 1300 people. So you name it, we\'ve, we\'ve, we\'ve made mistakes. How did you overcome those?You know, thank goodness for that one. That was my brother\'s idea, and I looked him in the eyes. I said, I\'m so glad this is your idea because if it was mine, I\'d, you would never, you know, stop talking about it.\n\nThat\'s one thing I I didn\'t realize your brother. I mean he helped get this business off the ground, right? What is that relationship like? Um, what was it like in theearly days,\n\nI guess? I mean, in the early days it was phone a friend, uh, for a lot of help, you know, originally.You know, traditionally capital was not what it is today, you know, you didn\'t just go out and raise money and so we really bootstrapped due to his American Express. He mortgaged his house for the brand. His wife could not buy groceries, but she got some beautiful leather bags.And um and then when we were able to secure, you know, uh loans on purchase orders, you know, but he he was the CEO for 17 years, so it was integral to the growth of the brand that he was\n\nthere before, uh,\n\nI, I\'m thinking back now to a couple of months ago we talked to the Property Brothers and of course they\'re brothers, they\'ve launched this amazing brand and it seems to flow with them, you know, they.They each have different strengths. Like how did you manage working with yourbrother?\n\nSo it was critical that we get good at communication, and I write about it in the book. We didn\'t always see eye to eye. We didn\'t always get along, but we would kind of reset more than once a year and say this is what I need and want from you and this is what I need and want from you, and I think anyone who\'s working with their partner.Whether it\'s a spouse, a friend, you know, a stranger, you have to do those resets. I advise once a quarter because things change. You might have kids or you want to travel more or you start, you know, wanting to take the business in another direction. If you don\'t have those touch points, man, it can, it can get wild.\n\nItalked to a full disclosure, I talked to a lot of robotic AI CEOs, entrepreneurs that seemingly got born and thinking about developing businesses, but what do you see.I would say the more average entrepreneur in terms of mistakes like what are they making right now in this environment that you know folks that don\'t have access to billions of dollars in a in a huge\n\nrolodex. I think especially for women, most women are starting consumer businesses and they\'re all going after VC and private equity money and not going after traditional forms of capital, whether it\'s a small business loan or again purchase order financing, you\'re gonna grow slower, but it\'s OK. What is wrong with having a slower growing healthy business that provides a.Lifestyle for you, your family, and your employees, and it\'s one thing that my co-founder and I at Female Founder Collective, we talk to women about this. It\'s OK to grow slow. What happened to Main Street USA where there was just these beautiful businesses that, you know, provided a great lifestyle for the people that worked there? Our\n\nfemale founders, I mean, there\'s countless stories written about this, and there\'s nothing new per se, but are they getting the capital they need?\n\nNo, they\'re not. The numbers have actually gone down. It\'s now 1.8% down from 2%. It\'s awful. It\'s, it\'s disgusting actually. um, there need to be more.Advocates in the room, there need to be more women, you know, investing and succeeding and again our mission at Female Founder Collective is to hopefully make the next level of women who are successful that can then invest in more founders. Why\n\nis this still even an issue? Why is ita problem?\n\nI think it\'s a problem because again a lot of women have consumer businesses. They should not be getting VC capital for them, so they\'re barking up the wrong tree sometimes, and the business has been largely built, not in a bad way.By you know male dominated fields and sectors where it\'s more male heavy, and I think on that level men need to say OK we need to pull more managing directors in as women or we need more investors in as women or more funds need to come in as women and then really taking a look at the strength of these businesses because you\'ll find that the exits these women have are usually a lot bigger because we\'re so worried about failing and messing it up for everyone else that we\'re sort of like, OK, this has to.\n\nAre you a bigwork life balance person or or are you maybe I look at myself, it\'s just all become one big blob like there is no separation at allof any of this.\n\nThere is no such thing as balance.\n\nThank\n\nyou. It\'s never existed for men or women. It\n\njust doesn\'t exist. It does\n\nnot exist. I try and call it work life integration or we can call it the blob, as you say, um, you know, for me it\'s sort of like taking a look at my week, you know, where can I, where do I know I\'m gonna be gone for my kids for a couple of days, where can I then over index when I\'m back.But to me, you know, the village has been stripped of us. We used to have a village and I\'m sort of into rebuilding my village who, who are those people? My husband, you know, my nanny, my mom, my dad, like who\'s helping.Create this thing where it\'s not always falling on me and what can I shed? Do I do the dishes now? No, I don\'t. You know, someone does them and that\'s real nice. It\'s\n\nkind of hard. It\'s nice. It\'s hard to do. I mean, how do you, I mean, how do you manage your, your time, especially as you were growing a business and you\'re still growing a business? You\n\nknow, I\'m, I\'m very type A. Everything is scheduled within an inch of my life and I\'m a big list analog list maker, you know, and so I sort of have this is the fires, this is the must do, this is the nice to do, this is when I\'m bored and like daydreaming.And I sort of just manage my life of what\'s most important and what can I focus on today that that moves me along to the next cycle. You know,\n\nto that end, uh, I think we\'re, we\'re a lot alike. Uh, I\'m kind of getting that vibe. I just got the new Amazon Echo show because Alexa Plus is coming out and it\'s like Amazon\'s AI thing. It just manages your whole life.\n\nIt does. I need this in my life.\n\nI\'m when they come, it should be coming out in a couple weeks like this thing is, is pretty, pretty dope, but like let\'s let\'s go inside your brand.Uh, I remember when your bags came out. I remember when you made that famous t-shirt. I was a stock analyst covering ironically accessible luxury handbag makers at the time, so it was coach before tapestry. Like\n\nwhat\'s hot right now?\n\nWhat\'s hot right now in my space.I mean right now these micro trends that you see happening on TikTok, you know, everyone has to have, you know, the small bag that fits nothing. Cool, that lasts for a week and then it\'s and then it\'s something else and so I think you know what\'s hot right now is everything because trends are happening quicker and quicker and quicker.Uh, but for us we\'re really about building a stable base and foundation of bags that are your everyday woman\'s bags and then from there we layer on these blips as fast as we can get them out, but we\'re not, we\'re not pinning our business on that. Is\n\nTikTok a big driver of your business? and I ask that because I, I talked to the Abercrombie and Fitch folks and what they have seen in terms of.How they\'ve marketed on TikTok and the sales are able to drive with the conversion off of that has been mind blowing.\n\nWell, we\'ve just taken it seriously in the last 6 months, so it\'s something that I don\'t have numbers on yet, but we will be launching it soon in a very heavy way for TikTok shops.\n\nHow do youknow, how do you know when something\'s going to be a hit?\n\nOh man, sometimes you have that feeling and sometimes you don\'t, you know, we had a bag become a hit recently. Uh, it\'s the Megan hobo and when I saw the bag I was like that\'s a beautiful bag.But the timing of, you know, Bohemian kind of coming back along with a similar brand which I won\'t name doing a very big expensive campaign with a bag that looked very similar at the same time it\'s always like kismet, and you can\'t plan that. I didn\'t know they were gonna have a bag that looked the same, uh, and so sometimes that happens and then other times, you know, it\'s price value ratio that the customers like, wow, she sees me and she made a gorgeous looking bag for me at an accessible price point. Why\n\ndo trends.From decades ago come back and I, I was thinking I see everybody wearing like flared jeans again. I remember these when I was in high school in the late 90s. Uh and I\'m having flashbacks as I walked down thestreet.\n\nYeah, uh, uh, some of these trends, you know, make me cringe, you know, love Kendrick Lamar, but when I saw the bootleg with the, with the cuff under.The shoe that gave me like odd. I was like this cannot come back um everyone\'s nostalgic, you know, in our day, you know, we wanted things from the 70s, you know, corduroy and flared pants that are now back and so I think this next generation is embracing things we did in the 90s and sadly that,\n\nthat old jeans,\n\nof course I remember\n\nJingo jeans was.\n\nNow I want a\n\npair, but there\'s just in this environment of cost, I don\'t think you can make those profitably. I mean, I don\'t know. That\'s just my take, but the weird thing was they always drag on the grounds. You always went home dirty.\n\nYou always went home dirty. If you live in the city, you are burning those things when you get home. It was awful.\n\nHang with us, Rebecca. We\'re gonna go off for a quick break. I want to get more into your book and also the state of retail. We\'ll be right back on opening bid.All right, welcome back on Opening bid here at the NASDAQ in the, uh, big beautiful Times Square talking with Rebecca Minkoff, new book Fearless The New Rules for Unlocking Creativity, courage, and Success. I want to talk a little bit about the state of retail because there\'s a lot of focus on, of course, as you can imagine, tariffs. Now I\'ve never designed a product. I\'ve never worked in a supply chain.How hard is it to adapt to a tariff when you are in the apparel industry?\n\nIt\'s impossible. So we\'re not dealing with it this time around. We dealt with it the last time tariffs were instituted.I think that year we thought we were going to make $3 million and we lost $3 million. You know, it was impossible with the timeline set forth to change your supply chain. I went to testify, you know, and rally for it, didn\'t help, and so it\'s really hurting a lot of businesses. The silver lining is we got out of China at that time. We\'re still out of China.And so that saved us a lot of money in the long run, but it\'s pain we didn\'t need, you know, I wish there was a little bit more time to adjust to these tariffs because our life cycle is 9 months from concept to hitting the floor. So if you don\'t have that.And you know then you then you\'re out of\n\nluck. I,\n\nthe, the retail executives I talked to, they continue to tell me, well, we\'re moving out of China, we\'re going to Vietnam and we\'re going to Indonesia and on paper, great, but is it the same quality or does China have some kind of secret sauce they\'re still able to better things.Vietnam\n\nand you know we\'ve been making in Vietnam and Indonesia for the last 3 years, and I don\'t see a difference in our quality at all and I think that the smart factories were already establishing strongholds in those places, so some of the factories that made our goods in China are the same factories that just happened to be in Indonesia and in Vietnam. Can you\n\nmake an amazing handbag profitably in the\n\nUS?\n\nYou can if you charge a lot more money. So I did this exercise a couple of years ago when I had a lot of my, you know, 20 year old fans demanding Made in New York City, Made in the USA, and I said, Cool, this is the price. I\'m happy to do it. I can go back to my factory on 38th Street. Let me know if you want to pay, and guess what? Crickets, you know, I am excited by the prospect. I know LVMH.Investing in Texas and I would love manufacturing to come back but it has to come back on a scale that it\'s not just the make, you know, it\'s the hardware it\'s all the filler that\'s inside of a bag everything needs to be made here because if you\'re buying it all from overseas anyways and assembling it here, you\'re still not saving very much money.\n\nIs ita is it a skill thing? We just don\'t have the trades people to make this.\n\nI think it is a skill thing, but you can.Train them. I mean, what\'s incredible is the factory here that I started with that\'s still around still has some of the people that have worked here, you know, for the last 20 years so I think it can be taught it\'s just do people wanna do that anymore like engage in hand craft making\n\nit seems like it seems like fun, right?\n\nI love visiting the factory here.\n\nIs there, um, is the reality though that we\'re just gonna have to spend more.On apparel this spring and summer. I mean this is what\'s coming at us, right? Well, we\'re\n\ngonna have to spend more on everything. I think eggs here are $14. Eggs everything is more\n\nexpensive. Can we just have some eggs for under\n\n14\n\ndollars.\n\nI\'m going to get a chicken. It\'s happening.\n\nWell, you know, and it\'s, and it\'s interesting because, you know, I walk into, I guess some of your competitors. I\'m not gonna name any names, and I see the quality out of these products.I see they change zippers. I see they\'re using different fabric. Are we\'re just gonna get just less made good stuff as a result of this?\n\nI think a lot of brands are going to do that, and it\'s gonna hurt them in the end. It might be the quick fix for now, but the customer sees it like you said, you noticed it, and you are not, you know, an everyday handbag consumer. I\'m going to assume, but\n\nI still study this. I still, so I used to be. I covered all the the accessible luxury makers, handbag makers, but.It was always I remember the time where they reinvested in quality like, OK, we\'re gonna double down an amazing button or an amazing zipper, and I don\'t know it seems to be going the other way now again.\n\nIt is going the other way for a lot of brands. I know for us it\'s key that we remain a quality that you know I still meet women who have had the bag for 1516, 20 years, and I still want her to have that experience 20 years later when I\'m walking around with a cane.\n\nWhat\'s next for Rebecca Minkoff, the the brand, um, wherever that might be. I know you have the podcast, but even so with the company.\n\nSo with the company, as as we are celebrating 20 years, I have a couple more collaborations up my sleeve that\'ll come out in Q4 of this year, and we\'re just gonna continue to, you know, message our expansion, our regrowth. We\'re still coming back from COVID, where 70% of our business evaporated.And so what does business look like in in this new world and you know getting really good at TikTok?\n\nWhat is, what did you learn during the pandemic? I mean 70% of your business gone. I mean you must have been like tall shit like what, what, what, wheredid it go?\n\nYeah, well.I knew exactly where it went unfortunately but we couldn\'t do anything about that, you know, with every department store closing their doors and they had to cancel their purchase orders so I think the one thing it taught us is we need to mind and grow our own garden and if we are not doing that top of mind every day.Then we will be left in the dust and so it taught us to care about our relationship with our consumer in a new way, how we talk to her, when we talk to her, the look and feel of the website, what we stand for as a brand, and from there then you go out and sell to everybody else. But I think before that every conversation every morning was what was the sell through at Nordstrom, Sachs, Neiman.And instead of saying what what did we do yesterday in sales and so that flip I think was a game changer for us.\n\nHas it surprised you by how many I guess um department stores have closed?\n\nIt\'s surprising, it\'s scary you know I, I get nostalgic and that\'s where I loved to shop, but I think everyone has to innovate, you know, and I think everyone\'s trying to figure it out.Out and what\'s going to draw the customer back into their store? It has to be about experience, creativity. You gotta romance the customer and really edit, you know, everything today is available anywhere you look. I\'m seeking a good edit. I don\'t want to have to sort through 20 pages of a website. So if I walk into a store, what is your point of view and what story are you tellingme?\n\nYou think we\'re at the coming to the day where there\'s just not going to be department stores.\n\nI certainly hope that\'s not the\n\ncase. It\'s still fun. It\'s\n\nstill fun to walk in a department store. I mean they, they\'re trying. They\'re really trying. They\'re putting restaurants in there like coffee shops like I mean, I appreciate the efforts, but to your point, it does need to be edited. It still feels too expansive. It\'s over 2 or 3 floors, just like, I don\'t know, boil it down somehow.\n\nYeah, our, our actually our most successful footprint when we had stores was we did a pop up at the Grove. It was 1000 square feet.And boy did we have to edit. I think we had 5 SKUs, and it was our best performing store by far.\n\nWho do yougo to, you know, the last few minutes of, uh, of the podcast, we always love to get hot takes from our guests. So who do you go to for advice? Like who\'s your business outreach line?\n\nOh my gosh. Well, thank God for Female Founder Collective. So my co-founder Alison Wyatt.But then I have a great group of founders, Michelle Cordero Grant, who\'s, you know, Gorgi or Alison Ellsworth from Poppy, you know, I\'m always also seeking women outside of my industry to get a different perspective and lens. I could talk to designers still I\'m blue in the face, and we\'re all saying the same thing. And so for me it\'s critical that I have different people in way different industries that I\'m talkingto.\n\nWhat has made those founders click? like why have they found success?\n\nI think that they\'re brilliant marketers, they\'re creative, they\'re scrappy, and I think that they\'re continuing to surprise and delight their consumer and in this day and age you have to do that.\n\nWhere, um, you know, in terms of like finding success, you know, because it\'s around the cover of your book, you know how have you gone upon doing that how do you.\n\nI think success changes every couple of years. What you define it as when I started out, it was, can I afford to eat out?\n\nThat\'s always a good, yeah,\n\ncan I, can I pay mybills\n\nor can I afford to share the bill when someone says, let\'s just split the check and you\'re cringing inside because you had a salad.Uh, success to me these days is more time with my children. It\'s being unbothered by email on nights and weekends. Is that you can\'t do\n\nthat. You have to check. I do\n\nit. No, you don\'t check\n\nemail. No.\n\nI, you know what I do as I go and I delete the junk so that on Monday it\'s just a clean slate of everything I have to answer. That is all I do now and to me that\'s success. And then, you know, meeting my customer this last year has been about storytelling and about reminding her about the journey of the brand and so when I get to meet someone like last night who said my first bag.Was this purchase I made as a celebration of my raise. Like those are the things that make me go, yes, this is success.\n\nWhere do you, where do you shop and what are your statement\n\nitems? I mean, I\'m not gonna lie, but lately I\'ve been only shopping at Rebecca Minkoff.\n\nWell,that\'s good. Like you have to go to other competitors stuff, right? I mean,\n\ncome on. So I actually haven\'t bought another competitor\'s stuff in a long time, but I do love Isabel Marant and I think she makes a beautiful product. Um, it is more.Expensive, but when I\'m splurging, that\'s who I go to.\n\nAlright, totally last one, I promise. Like what are the style mistakes you still see menmaking?\n\nMen making. Oh gosh, so men talking about doing these things, uh, I, you know, I know that skinny jeans are back for women, but they\'re not certainly not back for men. Embrace the loose pants.\n\nI\n\ncan\'t,\n\nI can\'t do the loose pants.\n\nGet a nicely tailored suit or do the Harry Styles thing and just really go the opposite direction, do the boxy suit, but it has to be the right boxy, you know,\n\nyou know I\'ve seen.Everything is baggy. You think we\'re just not going back to like tighter fits? No,\n\nIthink it\'s happening. I, I saw many men last night dressed up in tight suits, and I was like, Too soon, too soon, not yet. OK.\n\nWell, congrats on\n\nthis book, Rebecca McGough, Fearless, the new rules for unlocking creativity, courage and success. Really good to see you and, and congrats on all your success. Thank you for having me. All right, and that\'s it for the latest episode of Opening bid. Continue this with all those likes on the podcast platforms. Thumbs up on YouTube.

And they have plans to turn it into a billion-dollar empire.\n\nTalking to WWD about the new deal, Cardi explained how important quality is for her.\n\n“I could shop every single day, but there’s always that one pair of jeans that I love. There’s that tank top that I love, and I don’t care how many stains are on it, I’m gonna wear it, because I just love it,” she said. “I want my brand to have that one piece that you buy, that you love, that it makes sense. If it’s a size small, it should be a true size small; if it’s a size large, it should be a true size large.”\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAD\n\nAD LOADING...\n\nAD\n\nIn an Instagram post, Cardi added: “Coming from a Caribbean family the goal is always to OWN! Our belief in leaving this earth and leaving our children is leaving them with something! What our parents and grandparents work so hard for was real ownership! I’ve been very successful in my career and forever grateful for my success! But in my mind I know that when I leave this earth I would like to leave my kids more than property and a music catalog.\n\n“I want to leave them wit something they can carry for generations to come, something that their mother built from the ground up. I’m excited to announce my business ventures! I wanted to get into something I’m very passionate about and most importantly something that I know so much about. It has taken me years to perfect and tailor make it and here we are! To my partners, to my team thank you for believing in my vision!\n\n“Thank you for believing in me! I remember a time I used to be focused on making everyone else proud and meeting everyone else’s expectations but in this new season the only person I’m focused on out doing and making proud is myself! P.S my dress is from my line! Coming Soon!”\n\nWhile fans have waited nearly eight years for a sophomore album from Cardi B, she says it’s pretty much in the can now – so hopefully she won’t pull a Rihanna and never return to music as she flourishes with her other income.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAD\n\nAD LOADING...\n\nAD\n\nSpeaking on X Spaces, she hyped her eagerly anticipated project by saying: “The features on my album are really good. I don’t have a lot of features but I’m working with artists, some that I have worked with before and some that I haven’t worked with before. And the ones that I have not worked with before, I feel like it’s gonna really, really surprise y’all.”\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nrelated news\n\nCardi B Agrees To 5-Year, $1.1M Payment Plan From YouTuber For Defamation\n\nFebruary 24, 2025\n\nCardi continued: “It’s such a vibe.

ethics editor\n\nPublished:\n\nDozens of technology firms are continuing to put the lives and livelihoods of supply chain workers at risk by failing to meet even the most basic due diligence expectations around forced labour and human rights abuses, finds sectoral analysis.\n\nConducted by KnowTheChain (KTC) – a project run by the Business &amp; Human Rights Resource Centre (BHRRC) that is attempting to drive awareness and corporate action on the issue of forced labour in international supply chains – the benchmark analysis revealed that the world’s largest technology firms are neglecting their responsibilities to uphold their workers’ human rights.\n\nUsing a range of indicators such as recruitment, purchasing and monitoring practices, and workers’ rights to organise, KTC scored each of the 45 global tech firms out of 100 on their efforts to tackle forced labour and other human rights abuses in their operations.\n\nAcross all 45 companies benchmarked by KTC for 2025, just three (Hewlett Packard, Samsung and Cisco) scored over 50 out of 100, with the average score being just 20.\n\nForced labour and slavery are significant and continuing problems, and when it comes to the tech sector are particularly prevalent in the mining of raw materials and the production of components that make up technology products.\n\nThe International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates there are 24.9 million victims of forced labour globally, while the Global Slavery Index estimates there to be 40.3 million victims of modern slavery.\n\nFollowing the publication of its third benchmark report in June 2020, KTC found that tech firms were “negligent in their efforts to address forced labour” and that, following its fourth benchmark in January 2023, firms have “abjectly failed” to address the risks and impacts of forced labour throughout their supply chains, despite soaring profits at the time.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAccording to KTC’s latest benchmark analysis, while there has been progress in the establishment of policies, governance and baseline human rights due diligence processes, “it is equally clear that the gap between policy and practice is growing, with companies providing little evidence of how these policies and processes are implemented”.\n\nIt added that almost half of firms were given overall scores of less than 15/100 – including BOE (0), SMIC (3), Luxshare Precision Industry (4), Broadcom and Infineon Technologies (both 8), FujiFilm (9), Panasonic (10), Nvidia (11), Texas Instruments (12), Motorola and Canon (both 13), and Qualcomm (14) – while 93% of those assessed by KTC scored zero on their support for workers’ freedom of association.\n\n“The ICT sector continues to neglect its responsibility to uphold worker rights across supply chains and underperforms compared to sectors like apparel and footwear on key issues like support for freedom of association. It must step up its efforts to root out forced labour in supply chains as a matter of urgency,” said Áine Clarke, head of KTC and investor strategy at the BHRRC.\n\n“The benchmark findings on corporate human rights due diligence are particularly concerning as most electronics manufacturing is done in jurisdictions that pose heightened risk of forced labour, including China, Taiwan and Malaysia where human rights risks are well documented.”\n\nThe KTC benchmark further found that “purchasing practices” and “enabling workers’ rights” are the areas where companies performed worst, with the average being 5/100 for both indicators.\n\nWhile two-thirds of tech firms disclosed how they conduct human rights risk assessments on their supply chains, just one in five were able to disclose specific examples of engaging with stakeholders to assess risks, which KTC said shows little evidence of commitment to worker-centric models of risk identification.\n\nIts benchmark report noted that the “just-in-time” production models widely used in the tech sector create a greater risk of abuse to workers.\n\nIt also highlighted a specific need to protect Taiwan’s large migrant workforce, which it said is at heightened forced labour risks, such as recruitment fees and deceptive contracts, due to the fact it supplies 90% of the world’s advanced chips and is therefore crucial to global tech supply chains.\n\n“While many companies are adept at disclosing human rights policies, there is little evidence these commitments are being implemented in practice or having an effect on workers on the ground. The identified and widening gap between corporate commitments and their implementation means workers continue to be at risk of exploitation,” said Clarke.\n\n“Paper promises are not enough to meet growing legal and stakeholder expectations. Businesses must engage directly with rightsholders and move beyond a tick-box attitude to due diligence.”\n\nKTC is therefore calling on business leaders and supply chain and recruitment professionals to take immediate action by ensuring full risk-based human rights due diligence across their entire supply chains, as well as employing robust and ethical governance, purchasing and recruitment practices.\n\nIt is also calling on firms to engage with unions and other worker representative groups to uphold labour rights and prevent exploitations, and to use the European Union’s human rights due diligence laws as a floor for their practices.\n\nIn July 2022, Computer Weekly reported on how, despite the high reputational cost that tech companies face in being seen to benefit from forced labour practices, decision-makers within these enterprises continue to rely largely on voluntary reporting measures and static audit processes to deal with forced labour and slavery – something that is exacerbated by a culture of corporate and governmental inaction.\n\n### Read more about technology supply chains\n\n- Surveillance tech firms complicit in MENA human rights abuses: Research finds companies are profiting from surveillance technologies that facilitate human rights abuses against migrants, asylum seekers and refugees in the Middle East and North Africa, with little to no oversight.\n- Tech companies operating with opacity in Israel-Palestine: Tech firms operating in Occupied Palestinian Territories and Israel are falling “woefully short” of their human rights responsibilities amid escalating devastation in Gaza, says Business &amp; Human Rights Resource Centre.\n- EU fails to protect human rights in surveillance tech transfers: Transfers of surveillance technology from the European Union to African governments are carried out without due regard for the human rights impacts, the European Ombudsman has found after a year-long investigation into the European Commission’s management of an aid fund.\n\n#### Read more on IT jobs and recruitment\n\n- Labour\'s AI Action Plan - a gift to the far right\n\n\n\n\nBy: Dan\xa0McQuillan\n- European Parliament approves platform worker directive\n\n\n\n\nBy: Sebastian\xa0Klovig Skelton\n- Labour will use AI to grow the economy by 0.5%, says shadow tech secretary Peter Kyle\n\n\n\n\nBy: Bill\xa0Goodwin\n- TUC launches AI taskforce for workers’ rights and societal benefit\n\n\n\n\nBy: Brian\xa0McKenna\n\nLatest News\n\n- Keysight introduces AI network architecture validation, optimisation tool\n- Interview: Tomer Cohen, chief product officer, LinkedIn\n- StarHub trials first 5G cloud RAN network in Southeast Asia\n- View All News\n\nDownload Computer Weekly\n\n- In The Current Issue: Download Current Issue\n- <!-- image -->\n    - Behind the scenes at Amazon UK’s robotic-powered warehouse\n    - All change: Weighing up the options for enterprises as open source licences evolve\n\nLatest Blog Posts\n\n- Nutanix cloud VP: A complete and open Kubernetes on any infrastructure\n– CW Developer Network\n- Distrust builds between digital ID sector and government amid speculation over \'ID cards by stealth\'\n– Computer Weekly Editors Blog\n- View All Blogs\n\nRelated Content\n\n- Tech firms failing to address forced labour in supply...\n– ComputerWeekly.com\n- Major technology companies ‘negligent’ on forced ...\n– ComputerWeekly.com\n- Tech sector efforts to root out forced labour are ...\n– ComputerWeekly.com\n\n- CIO\n- Security\n- Networking\n- Data Center\n- Data Management\n\n- How quantum cybersecurity changes the way you protect data\nHere\'s a full guide to the threats quantum computers pose to today\'s encryption algorithms -- and how to prepare now to become "...\n- What are the 4 different types of blockchain technology?\nEach blockchain network has distinct pluses and minuses that largely drive its ideal uses.\n- The 6 different types of quantum computing technology\nTechnology providers offer several paths to the promised land of quantum advantage, but customers must navigate the engineering ...\n\n- IAM compliance: Know the system controls at your disposal\nIAM is critical to an organization\'s data security posture, and its role in regulatory compliance is just as crucial.\n- How to prevent a data breach: 11 best practices and tactics\nWhen it comes to data breach prevention, the stakes are high.

If Trump unveils milder-than-anticipated tariffs, Sensex and Nifty may experience a rebound led by export-oriented sectors, including pharma and IT. Conversely, severe tariff impositions could trigger further market deterioration.\n\n"India has historically had higher tariffs on US goods than the US imposes on Indian goods. This means India is one of the key targets for Trump’s tariff realignment. The impact could be significant across pharmaceuticals, automobiles, agriculture, and textiles, disrupting billions in trade,” said Ross Maxwell, Global Strategy Operations Lead at VT Markets.\n\nWhile India is attempting to negotiate a diplomatic resolution, some analysts fear that tit-for-tat responses from other nations could escalate into a full-scale trade war. "The imposition of US tariffs could disrupt momentum for export-driven sectors, particularly those reliant on discretionary spending, while also sparking intense price competition from other affected economies. This uncertainty could keep private sector capital expenditure on the sidelines until clearer signals emerge," said Sachin Gupta, Executive Director and Chief Rating Officer, CareEdge Ratings.\n\n## Sectors on the Chopping Block\n\n## 1) Electronics: India’s Largest Export to the US Under Threat\n\nIndia’s electronics exports to the US totaled $11.1 billion in FY24, making up 14% of the country\'s total exports to America. The US, in turn, accounts for a staggering 32% of India\'s electronics exports. A sectoral tariff differential of 9% could hit this industry hard, analysts say.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### Live Events\n\nMore than half of India’s electronics exports to the US are mobile phones, predominantly iPhones assembled in India. If the tariffs increase sharply, it could force Apple and other manufacturers to rethink their India production strategies.\n\n## 2) Gems &amp; Jewellery: A $9.9 Billion Trade Facing Uncertainty\n\nGems and jewellery, a sector where India is a global leader, is at significant risk. The US accounts for 30% ($9.9 billion) of India’s total $33 billion exports in this category, including cut and polished diamonds, studded gold jewellery, and lab-grown diamonds.\n\n“Hefty tariffs on India would hurt exports heavily, as it is easy to shift sourcing for many of these products to other countries with lower tariffs/FTAs. Indian manufacturers could also relocate to Singapore, the UAE, or Oman if heavy tariffs are imposed on Indian exports. Given the labor-intensive nature of this sector, a significant drop in exports would be extremely detrimental for employment,” Emkay Global warned.\n\n## 3) Pharmaceuticals: A Critical Industry at Crossroads\n\nIndia supplies 47% of US generic drug imports by volume, making it a vital partner in America’s healthcare system. The low value-high volume nature of India’s generic drug exports reflects the low cost of Indian pharma products, which makes it attractive for the US, and hence difficult to replace, analysts said.\n\n"We think the most bearish scenario is a tariff of about 35% for generic products manufactured in India. On the other hand, the bullish outcome could result in no tariff on generic drugs given the economic unviability of US manufacturing and the likelihood of reaching a successful bilateral trade agreement. Both these scenarios are unlikely in the near term, in the context of the 2 April announcements. On 2 April, the US is likely to impose reciprocal tariffs on India, and there may be no announcement on pharmaceutical tariffs,” Nomura said.\n\nIt said a tariff of less than 10% is likely to drive a positive reaction in Indian pharma stocks given current expectations. On the other hand, a tariff higher than 10% can potentially drive further correction in pharma stocks.\n\nMost pharma companies are confident they can pass on tariff costs to US buyers, limiting their financial impact.\n\n## 4) Automobiles &amp; Auto Components: Potential Blow to Indian Players\n\nAs the US is not a significant export destination for India’s vehicle exports, the direct impact on OEMs may be limited, but auto component makers face risks. India’s auto component exports to the US accounted for 27% of total exports in FY24. Key players such as Sona Comstar (43% of revenue from North America) and Samvardhana Motherson (18% revenue from the US) are exposed.\n\nTata Motors could also face an impact due to Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), which derives over 30% of its sales from the US. With no US manufacturing base, JLR vehicles will be subject to tariffs, affecting profitability, analysts noted.\n\n"Tariffs on key components such as engines, transmission, and powertrains could disrupt supply chains. However, most Indian component manufacturers have diversified export bases, which could mitigate the overall impact,” Asit C Mehta’s Mrunmayee Jogalekar said.\n\n## 5) Textiles &amp; Apparel: 28% of Exports to the US at Stake\n\nIndia’s textile and apparel exports to the US totaled $9.6 billion in FY24, accounting for 28% of the industry’s total exports. This sector faces competition from countries like Bangladesh and Vietnam, which could gain a cost advantage if Indian goods become more expensive due to tariffs.\n\n"India’s textile and apparel exports would be among the worst hit if reciprocal tariffs are imposed at a broad sectoral level,” analysts at Emkay said.\n\n## Impact on IT stocks\n\n## Markets Await the Final Word\n\n#### Read More News on\n\n(What\'s moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2025, Share Market on Budget 2025 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.

Just recently, a fire at Brazil's Maximus factory left workers hospitalized. In India, a textile unit crumbled, claiming multiple lives. Despite decades of scrutiny, workplace safety remains an afterthought in too many corners of the industry.\n\nBut amidst this grim backdrop, Bangladesh stands out for how dramatically it has changed course.\n\nThe 2013 Rana Plaza disaster was a turning point. In the deadliest garment factory collapse in history, more than 1,100 workers lost their lives. The shock reverberated worldwide, but for Bangladesh, it was a call for action. What followed was a sweeping overhaul of its textiles industry.\n\nToday, Bangladesh is the world's second-largest apparel exporter, not just because of its output but because of the strides it has taken to make manufacturing safer, fairer, and more accountable.\n\nLandmark reforms like the Accord on Fire and Building Safety have upgraded 850 factories and improved conditions for over a million workers, drawing $70 million in brand-backed investments. Alongside it, the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety has inspected hundreds of sites, trained thousands, and driven sweeping safety upgrades.\n\nThe government, too, has stepped up. Labor laws now mandate worker safety committees in all factories with over 50 employees. Unionization, once notoriously difficult, has become more accessible—the number of trade unions has surged from 132 in 2012 to over 1,000 today. A 56% minimum wage hike in 2023 helped improve living standards and boosted purchasing power among garment workers.\n\nRegulatory oversight has also tightened. Stronger regulatory bodies conduct frequent inspections, and the Department of Inspection for Factories and Establishments (DIFE) has been strengthened to conduct regular safety audits, while new labor courts offer workers clearer recourse for unsafe conditions and exploitation.\n\nUnder interim Prime Minister Muhammad Yunus, Bangladesh pledged to align labor laws with international ILO standards, appointing a special envoy to drive legislative reform and respond to long-standing concerns from unions, global labor watchdogs, and Western governments.\n\nThese social and legal reforms have unfolded alongside a technological shift. Smart factories are rapidly adopting automation, AI tools, and Internet of Things (IoT) systems to streamline production and improve working conditions. A 2024 survey noted that 85% of Bangladeshi workers using semi-automated systems experienced reduced physical strain, especially in labor-intensive tasks like knitting and stitching. Error rates dropped by 50%, and 97% of workers stated they hit production targets more easily.\n\nSustainability, once seen as a luxury add-on, is becoming standard practice. Waterless dyeing techniques, laser cutting, and cleaner energy use are reshaping the manufacturing landscape, helping Bangladesh evolve from a low-cost producer to a future-focused, environmentally conscious hub.\n\nThe result? Fewer accidents. Safer workplaces. And crucially, a growing culture where workers are encouraged to speak up about safety concerns. Together, greater accountability and workplace improvements are reshaping how clothes are made—and who gets protected in the process.\n\nAnd the world is noticing.\n\nEven during the global slowdown, textile exports to the U.S. rose to $7.34 billion, while European demand surged to $11.81 billion, led by a 13.47% rise in Germany alone. Other core markets like Spain, France, and the Netherlands also posted strong growth, reflecting sustained European demand for Bangladeshi textiles.\n\nBangladesh's ambitions go far beyond garment exports. A wave of ambitious transformation—including modern airports, expressways, upgraded logistic hubs, and sustainably designed five-star hotels—is reshaping the country into a more connected, investment-ready destination for global fashion brands and retail giants. Outside the cities, modern industrial zones like the Korean Export Processing Zone (KEPZ) in Chattogram showcase the future of eco-friendly manufacturing. Here, leafy avenues merge into green manufacturing facilities that provide healthcare and technical education for workers and their families.\n\nAs Bangladesh gears up to graduate from Least Developed Country (LDC) status in November 2026—a bold step toward its vision of becoming a developed economy by 2041—the textiles sector remains at the heart of its development strategy. The government is pushing for full transparency in the industry: brands sourcing from Bangladesh must now disclose supply chain information, aligning practices with U.S. and EU labor regulations. These reforms are propelling the country toward a more ethical, accountable manufacturing future.\n\nDhaka's labor reforms have earned nods from global institutions like the World Bank, whose B-READY 2024 framework spotlights Bangladesh's advances in labor rights and business environment reform.\n\nThis isn't just recovery—it's reinvention. Bangladesh's journey from the ruins of Rana Plaza to the forefront of ethical manufacturing is a testament to what's possible when tragedy leads to reform and reform leads to lasting change.\n\n© Copyright IBTimes 2024.

Please let us know if you have .\n\nAs one of the most promising, and fear-inducing, technologies of the day, artificial intelligence was a frequent topic of conversation across panels at Shoptalk’s spring conference in Las Vegas. Much like at the National Retail Federation’s Big Show in January, retailers considered the possibilities of the tech, how they go about implementing it and the ways retail remains very human.\n\nPerhaps one of the most succinct statements about retail’s use of AI came from Mandeep Bhatia, senior vice president of global digital product and omnichannel innovation at Tapestry, who was in turn quoting someone else.\n\n“Humans won’t be replaced by AI. Humans with AI will replace humans without AI,” Bhatia said, a sentiment that was echoed across many panels as retailers considered how the tech could be useful and where human involvement is still very much needed.\n\nAcross the industry, retailers are turning to AI to help with customer experience initiatives and to boost loss prevention, while shoppers are turning to the technology to help them with purchases as well. Opinions are thus far mixed, but there’s no doubt that AI is one of the hottest testing grounds in retail right now.\n\nHere’s a sampling of what companies had to say about the technology at Shoptalk Spring — and how they’re using it now.\n\n### Toys R Us\n\nAt Toys R Us, the brand jumped headfirst into AI with OpenAI’s Sora tool. According to Kim Miller, global chief marketing officer of toys at Toys R Us owner WHP Global, the retailer was the first to make a branded video through Sora. The retailer chose to make an homage to Charles Lazarus, who founded Toys R Us.\n\nAlthough video storytelling with AI “has a long way to go,” Miller said it’s been improving quickly — and the effort at Toys R Us paid off.\n\n“The video went viral,” Miller said. “A lot of people were asking, ‘Why did you do it?’ And I said, ‘The train has left the station and we wanted to be the first one on it. And we wanted to embrace it.’ We want to always be embracing new ways to tell stories and to reach people so that they are interested in not only the story you're telling, but how you're telling it as well.”\n\n### Meta\n\n“All the small guys, startups, they're going — they're on the train first. They're experimenting. They're doing it. Where a lot of bigger brands go, ‘I'm going to wait. Maybe it won't fit my brand DNA. It's scary.’ But it is the ones who take the risk in this moment of gaining competitive advantage [that] will win,” Karin Tracy, group lead of retail and e-commerce at Meta, said. “I feel like so many have gotten over the hump of automation … the next hump is Gen AI for creative.”\n\nMeta already offers GenAI tools for ad creation, including background and text generation, according to Clara Shih, vice president of business AI at Meta. In one example, Shih said Living Proof saw a 13% higher click-through rate using its tools and 18% higher total purchase volume. But when it comes to creative, Tracy noted that human creativity is still a key part of that process.\n\n“It's for the brands who figure out how to supplement the efforts of their creative team, of all the mundane stuff that's taking their time — think resizing images, writing different versions of copy, even making a still image move — these little moments that will have incremental points in performance and lead to this diversification that we know needs to happen,” Tracy said. “There's really low-risk ways you can get on the train. Doesn't have to be a full video yet, but there's ways that you can absolutely start using this and giving your creative teams time to be creative.”\n\nMeta is also rolling out new ways for brands to use AI, including ads that customers can have a conversation with. Shih outlined a test case of this functionality with Kitsch, in which a shopper sees a video ad for a shampoo bar and has the ability to then ask the ad whether it will work for their hair type and order three different bars through the conversation. Voice agents like this also have the potential to break down silos between customer support and purchase-focused marketing chatbots, according to Shih.\n\n“That voice agent might have a conversation with a consumer about pre-sales questions about the product — just asking if there's different allergens, how quickly can it be shipped to a certain location — but there also might be customer support questions,” Shih said. “In the past, we've deployed chatbots that were just for marketing or just for support. And so I think it's just time to make it a more cohesive customer experience and AI to lead the way and enable that going forward.”\n\nThe social media giant also just released omnichannel ads, which use AI models to connect shoppers with products that are in stores in addition to online. Shih proposed the example of a customer in Las Vegas shopping for makeup for the night, who needs to buy a product in person.\n\n“Our local ads can now show which store nearby, across the street in the Las Vegas mall, has this particular product in stock and target us specifically because of a variety of factors that AI picks up,” Shih said.\n\nOverall, Shih likened the state of AI now to the early days of the internet.\n\n“Roll up your sleeves and start trying. I think that AI is one of those technologies that you really learn best by doing,” Shih said. “Those who are able to lean in, just like those who were able to embrace e-commerce early 20 years ago, it's a moment to create sustained competitive advantage.”\n\n### Foot Locker\n\n“I think it can be really tempting with retail tech trends to think of it as an ‘or,’ right? It’s framed as stores or digital, human-centric experiences or AI-powered experiences,” Kim Waldmann, global chief customer officer for Foot Locker, said. “It's easy to get to the ‘or,’ but really it's a false dichotomy. I think what we really believe at Foot Locker is tech enables more human powered-experiences … tech and AI can remove some of the more mundane, transactional, manual work from our store employees and free them up to do what they do best, which is be creative, storytell.”\n\nAs one example, Waldmann highlighted that the retailer is using AI to sift through customer experience data and help customer service employees resolve issues faster. That has in turn improved net promoter scores. The retailer also uses AI to create product details that are relevant for different markets — for example, translated into a different language or using different measurements — from the same product photo.\n\nImproving search results and product recommendations on the retailer’s website is another “key focus,” according to Waldmann. But many of the applications are on the back-end. Foot Locker has invested in business reporting and intelligence functionalities that use AI, for example.\n\n“Right now, you can make a vocal command or vocal request of the system and get, for instance, what were my gross margins and sales in Spain yesterday?”\xa0Frank Bracken, who was named president of Foot Locker last week, said. “And a report is generated automatically.”\n\nAn AI-driven workforce management system the retailer recently implemented takes into account data like sales forecasts and promotional calendars to help land the right number of employees in stores.\n\n“The more productive we can be as an organization, the more we can flow into consumer-facing investments, whether it's brand building, whether it's storytelling or more refreshes and reimagined Foot Lockers,” Bracken said. “So it becomes a very perpetuating cycle in a great way.”\n\n### Google\n\n“We can't say it enough that AI is a significant opportunity, not just to run better ads, but to actually run a better business,” Sean Scott, vice president and general manager of consumer shopping at Google, said. “And I really do think the brands that are the most willing to adapt and the most quickest to adapt will be the ones that get ahead.”\n\nFor Google (and sister company YouTube), AI is behind features like Google Lens (which allows shoppers to search for items based on images), AR product viewing and local shopping. Much like Meta’s omnichannel ads, Google’s local shopping lets customers locate an item at a store nearby versus just online. As an example, Scott noted he’d used Google to locate a part he needed to fix a leaky faucet and picked it up that day at a nearby store. But it only works if brands participate.\n\n“What that means is you have to upload not just your online inventory or not just one store’s inventory, but all of your stores’ inventory,” Scott said. “Because, again, shoppers are everywhere and if you're going to reach them wherever they're at, you need to make sure that that inventory is available for them so dads like me can fix leaky faucets.”\n\nWhen it comes to features like Google Lens, Scott said the company sees about 20 billion visual searches per month and 25% of them have commercial intent. The executive also noted that AI is helping make very specific searches on Google yield more helpful results. A search for “men’s jeans for a Shoptalk keynote” brought up advice for dark washes and straight cuts, according to Scott, whereas a search for “skis for the Pacific Northwest” recommended wider skis to cope with the heavier snow in the region.\n\n“What's really, I think, unique and amazing about all this is that we're not a retailer. We don't have any inventory. We don't ship anything,” Scott said. “And yet, over a billion times a day, people are shopping across Google.”\n\n### Tapestry\n\nSummarizing associate feedback and generating product copy are two ways Tapestry is already using AI — and the luxury retailer is also considering how it can be used to generate code and experiences faster. But even as more uses become obvious, it’s important to start simple.\n\n“Let's be real, right? There is fear in peoples’\xa0mind, there is hesitation in peoples’ mind,”\xa0Bhatia said.\xa0“And how is it going to impact my life? How is it going to impact my job? And those things are very real and you need to acknowledge that — you need to have empathy with that.”\n\nBhatia stressed the need to train employees and bring them along on the journey across all levels of the organization.\n\n“Have a lot of empathy with people, try different things and then create communities where it's safe to ask questions, where it's safe to learn, and that's how this change and training will happen,” Bhatia said.\n\n- purchase licensing rights\n\n### Retail Dive news delivered to your inbox\n\nGet the free daily newsletter read by industry experts\n\n- Select Newsletter:\n\n\nDaily Dive\nM-F\n- Select Newsletter:\n\n\nDTC Weekly\nEvery Tuesday\n- Select Newsletter:\n\n\nMarketing Weekly\nEvery Wednesday\n- Select Newsletter:\n\n\nTech Weekly\nEvery Thursday\n- Select Newsletter:\n\n\nOperations Weekly\nEvery Monday\n- Select user consent:\n\n\n\n\n    By signing up to receive our newsletter, you agree to our\n    Terms of Use and\n    Privacy Policy.

The vulnerability affects multiple versions including 11.0.0-M1 to 11.0.2, 10.1.0-M1 to 10.1.34, and 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.98. Exploitation requires write-enabled default servlet, partial PUT support, and specific file handling conditions.\n\n“The original implementation of partial PUT used a temporary file based on the user provided file name and path with the path separator replaced by “.”.”\xa0reads the advisory.\n\n“If all of the following were true, a malicious user was able to view security sensitive files and/or inject content into those files:\n\n- writes enabled for the default servlet (disabled by default)\n- support for partial PUT (enabled by default)\n- a target URL for security sensitive uploads that is a sub-directory of a target URL for public uploads\n- attacker knowledge of the names of security sensitive files being uploaded\n- the security sensitive files also being uploaded via partial PUT\n\nIf all of the following were true, a malicious user was able to perform remote code execution:\n\n- writes enabled for the default servlet (disabled by default)\n- support for partial PUT (enabled by default)\n- application was using Tomcat’s file based session persistence with the default storage location\n- application included a library that may be leveraged in a deserialization attack”\n\nTomcat versions 9.0.99, 10.1.35, and 11.0\xa0addressed\xa0the vulnerability.\n\nWallarm researchers confirmed active exploitation of the flaw and added that attackers can hijack Apache Tomcat servers with a single PUT API request. PoC is online.\n\n“A devastating new remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability,\xa0CVE-2025-24813, is now actively exploited in the wild. ” reads the\xa0advisory\xa0published by Wallarm. “Attackers need just one PUT API request to take over vulnerable Apache Tomcat servers. The exploit, originally published by a Chinese forum user iSee857, is already available online: CVE-2025-24813 PoC by iSee857.”\n\nThe attack exploits Tomcat’s session persistence and partial PUT requests by uploading a malicious Java session file and triggering deserialization via a GET request.\n\nThe attack involves two steps:\n\n1. Uploading a Malicious Serialized Session\xa0– The attacker sends a PUT request containing a base64-encoded ysoserial gadget chain, storing it in Tomcat’s session directory.\n2. Triggering Execution via Session Cookie\xa0– A GET request with the JSESSIONID referencing the malicious session forces Tomcat to deserialize and execute the payload, granting remote access.\n\n“This attack is dead simple to execute and requires no authentication. The only requirement is that Tomcat is using file-based session storage, which is common in many deployments.” concludes the advisory. “Worse, base64 encoding allows the exploit to bypass most traditional security filters, making detection challenging.”\n\nWallarm researchers warn that most Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) fail to detect this attack because the PUT request appears normal and lacks obvious malicious content. The payload is base64-encoded, evading pattern-based detection, and the attack occurs in two steps, with execution happening only during deserialization. Additionally, most WAFs do not thoroughly inspect uploaded files or track multi-step exploits. As a result, by the time organizations notice the breach in their logs, it is already too late.\n\nUsers are recommended to update their affected Tomcat versions immediately to mitigate potential threats.\n\nAccording to\xa0Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities, FCEB agencies have to address the identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect their networks against attacks exploiting the flaws in the catalog.\n\nExperts also recommend private organizations review the\xa0Catalog\xa0and address the vulnerabilities in their infrastructure.\n\nCISA orders federal agencies to fix this vulnerability by\xa0April 22, 2025.\n\nFollow me on Twitter:\xa0@securityaffairs\xa0and\xa0Facebook\xa0and\xa0Mastodon\n\nPierluigi\xa0Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs\xa0–\xa0hacking, CISA)\n\n#### you might also like\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n##### New Triada Trojan comes preinstalled on Android devices\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n##### New advanced FIN7\'s Anubis backdoor allows to gain full system control on Windows\n\n#### leave a comment\n\n#### newsletter\n\n###### Subscribe to my email list and stay\n up-to-date!\n\n#### recent articles\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n###### New Triada Trojan comes preinstalled on Android devices\n\nMalware / April 03, 2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n###### New advanced FIN7\'s Anubis backdoor allows to gain full system control on Windows\n\nMalware / April 02, 2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n###### U.S. CISA adds Apache Tomcat flaw to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog\n\nSecurity / April 02, 2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n###### Apple backported fixes for three actively exploited flaws to older devices\n\nSecurity / April 02, 2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n###### Spike in Palo Alto Networks scanner activity suggests imminent cyber threats\n\nHacking / April 02, 2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo contact me write an email to:\n\n\n                            Pierluigi Paganini : \n\n[email\xa0protected]\n\n#### QUICK LINKS\n\n- Home\n- Cyber Crime\n- Cyber warfare\n- APT\n- Data Breach\n- Deep Web\n- Digital ID\n- Hacking\n- Hacktivism\n- Intelligence\n- Internet of Things\n- Laws and regulations\n- Malware\n- Mobile\n- Reports\n- Security\n- Social Networks\n- Terrorism\n- ICS-SCADA\n- POLICIES\n- Contact me\n\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2024\n\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

(LULU): A Bull Case Theory\n\nRicardo Pillai\n\n## In This Article:\n\nWe came across a\xa0bullish thesis\xa0on Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU) on Substack by Northwest Frontier Capital. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on LULU. Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU)\'s share was trading at $279.63 as of April 1st. LULU’s trailing and forward P/E were 19.10 and 18.02 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\n\n11 Best Retail Dividend Stocks to Buy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA customer in a specialty concept store wearing a full outfit of apparels and sports gear.\n\nLululemon\'s recent earnings report presents a nuanced picture of both short-term pressures and long-term potential. While Q1 guidance disappointed, the company\'s fundamentals remain intact, with strong margins, a resilient brand, and robust international expansion. Lululemon\'s focus on product innovation and "newness" has resonated with consumers, maintaining conversion rates and increasing average order values, signaling that brand loyalty remains high despite macroeconomic uncertainties. International growth, particularly in China, continues to be a key driver, with over 20% growth, even as North America faces cyclical challenges. Management\'s emphasis on strategic marketing and disciplined inventory management has preserved sector-leading margins above 20%, reinforcing the brand\'s premium positioning.\n\nDespite trading at its lowest valuation in a decade, Lululemon continues to outperform its long-term growth targets set in FY21. The company’s Q4 2024 revenue reached $3.6 billion, up 13% year-over-year, driven by flat comparable sales in the Americas and strong international expansion. However, Q1 guidance fell short of expectations, with projected revenue of $2.335-$2.355 billion and full-year FY25 revenue of $11.15-$11.3 billion, both slightly below consensus estimates. EPS projections of $2.53-$2.58 for Q1 and $14.95-$15.15 for FY25 were also lower than anticipated, raising concerns about North American demand. Management attributed the weaker guidance to softer traffic in the region, driven by inflationary pressures and consumer hesitancy, alongside tough year-over-year comparables. However, Lululemon remains resilient relative to peers, with its brand strength mitigating some of these headwinds.\n\nEncouragingly, while overall traffic may be down, Lululemon has maintained stable conversion rates and increased average order values, underscoring the strength of its pricing power and product appeal. The company\'s ability to successfully introduce new product innovations, such as the Daydrift line, demonstrates its ability to defend its market position against competitors like Alo and Vuori. Management\'s confidence in product momentum suggests that concerns over competition may be overblown, with attention shifting toward macroeconomic uncertainties instead. The broader market may be underestimating Lululemon’s ability to navigate these challenges, as its FY25 guidance already assumes persistently weak traffic trends, leaving room for potential upside if consumer behavior stabilizes.\n\nLululemon\'s international expansion remains a major growth lever, particularly in China, where sales continue to grow at an impressive pace. Unlike some global brands facing volatility in international markets, Lululemon’s traction in China and other regions has remained steady. Management noted that brand awareness remains low in key international markets, implying significant runway for future growth. With international sales accounting for 22% of total revenue and gaining two percentage points annually, the segment is positioned to enhance overall margins and drive long-term performance.\n\nMargins remain a critical indicator of Lululemon’s financial health. Despite a tough retail environment, gross margins expanded by 65 basis points in FY24, reflecting favorable product mix and disciplined markdown strategies. While management is guiding for a slight contraction in 2024 due to tariffs and foreign exchange impacts, these are external pressures rather than structural weaknesses. The company’s ability to sustain high average order values suggests pricing power remains intact, further supporting long-term margin strength.\n\nLululemon\'s EBIT margins also reflect a mix of short-term caution and long-term strategy. The company has maintained marketing spend at approximately 5% of sales to bolster brand awareness, even during periods of softer product momentum. This approach proved effective in sustaining demand during the holiday season and positions Lululemon well as new product launches accelerate in 2025. Management remains focused on balancing investment in brand activation with financial discipline, ensuring that marketing efforts translate into sustained consumer engagement.\n\nIn sum, while macroeconomic pressures and North American traffic concerns have weighed on sentiment, Lululemon’s underlying business remains robust. The company\'s international expansion, strong brand equity, disciplined inventory management, and innovative product pipeline provide a strong foundation for long-term growth. With shares trading at historically low valuations, Lululemon presents an attractive investment opportunity, particularly as market concerns appear more cyclical than structural. If management successfully navigates short-term headwinds, there is potential for meaningful upside as investor confidence in the brand’s resilience returns.\n\nLululemon Athletica Inc.

However, worryingly, it found that 48% of retailers cited networking and IT as the biggest frustration, ahead of budget (40%) and staffing issues (32%) when launching new technology-based services in stores.\n\nPerhaps worse, 52% of technology decision-makers at retailers believe technology issues are their biggest blockers to creating resilient retail branch networks. Some 70% identified fixed broadband as a blocker to creating a standardised in-store service, likely due to the physical fragility of fibre cables leading to network outages or lack of fibre in some areas of the UK, said Ericsson. It added that the need for specialist equipment to install cables can make it complex to upgrade connectivity as requirements evolve.\n\nAs a result of these issues, over a third (37%) of large retailers said they had been forced to offer scaled-down services at more remote locations, and nearly two-fifths (39%) notice varying levels of customer experience, leading to 38% experiencing a loss of revenue at remote branch locations because of poor connectivity.\n\nYet despite these sentiments, the survey also discovered that retailers were relying on connectivity to enhance customer experience security. As regards the former, 72% of the survey offered in-store Wi-Fi and 57% used it for personalised marketing. Additionally, 60% have adopted the\xa0internet of things (IoT) for digital signage for real-time offers, and over half (55%) have used AI and machine learning to support dynamic pricing.\n\nAs an example of this, Ericsson noted that in a deployment of its technology, operator T-Mobile needed 100% uptime at its 5,000-plus stores to support digital signs and payment systems. However, adding more wires to thousands of stores was not cost effective, so it turned to its own cellular broadband network and Ericsson Cradlepoint cellular adaptors to provide failover support, keeping critical application and IoT devices online 24/7.\n\n### Read more about retail networking\n\n- HPE opens shop for retail-ready networks: Security-first, AI-powered capabilities said to help retailers improve customer experience and operational efficiency,\xa0detecting negative impacts and transmitting remedies to improve the omnichannel experience.\n- Stretched retail IT teams demand more from their networks: Research shows retail technology requirements are becoming denser and more complex, from immersive and live-streaming services to new forms of delivery and smart inventory.\n- McArthurGlen gets tailor-made connectivity and security for fashion outlets: Critical network infrastructure provider teams with bespoke network services company to deliver reliable and secure connectivity for McArthurGlen’s nine retail sites across the UK.\n\nDespite stores in the UK investing\xa0£1.8bn in security measures such as CCTV in 2024, customer theft still hit £2.2bn, nearly three times the level of 2020. The survey found that in the UK, only half (50%) of retailers have invested in enhanced asset management or inventory control tools, and just 54% have adopted IoT tools to support asset tagging and tracking. If companies are to increase their deployment of these measures, and ensure their effectiveness, they must have the right connectivity infrastructure in place to allow real-time data sharing.\n\nLooking to the future, Ericsson said retailers must focus on the future to stay competitive, resilient and adaptable in an evolving market. It stressed that AI adoption was rising, with 49% of retailers already using AI chatbots, which can help reduce the workload on human workers and allow them to focus on higher-value tasks. Likewise, 39% were deploying AI to inform dynamic pricing, which can help boost revenues, and 29% were currently testing additional use cases across the business.\n\nThe bottom line conclusion drawn by Ericsson was that to effectively support retailers, next-generation technology requires a reliable, robust and secure network. “Retailers are operating under vast amounts of pressure as they face higher tax bills, reduced customer spending and rising safety issues,” said Paul McHugh, UK area director at Ericsson Enterprise Wireless Solutions. “While many see the use of technology like AI and IoT as a way of overcoming these challenges, it is clear that out-of-date connectivity infrastructure is leaving them hamstrung.\n\n“Wired connectivity, like fibre, does not provide the necessary flexibility or resilience needed to support a universal customer experience across all store locations,” he added.\n\n“Cellular networks are the answer. They can supply secure and reliable connectivity from day one with the necessary bandwidth and low latency to support new in-store technology. Good connectivity is no longer optional – it’s essential to stay alive and ensure success in a technological-first world.”\n\n#### Read more on Mobile apps and software\n\n- HPE opens shop for retail-ready networks\n\n\n\n\nBy: Joe\xa0O’Halloran\n- UK economy loses £17.6bn due to fixed connectivity outages\n\n\n\n\nBy: Joe\xa0O’Halloran\n- Singtel rolls out network slicing on 5G network\n\n\n\n\nBy: Aaron\xa0Tan\n- McArthurGlen gets tailor-made connectivity and security for fashion outlets\n\n\n\n\nBy: Joe\xa0O’Halloran\n\nLatest News\n\n- UKtech50 2025 – help us find the most influential people in UK IT\n- Tech sector still failing to rid supply chains of forced labour\n- Keysight introduces AI network architecture validation, optimisation tool\n- View All News\n\nDownload Computer Weekly\n\n- In The Current Issue: Download Current Issue\n- <!-- image -->\n    - Behind the scenes at Amazon UK’s robotic-powered warehouse\n    - All change: Weighing up the options for enterprises as open source licences evolve\n\nLatest Blog Posts\n\n- Nutanix cloud VP: A complete and open Kubernetes on any infrastructure\n– CW Developer Network\n- Distrust builds between digital ID sector and government amid speculation over \'ID cards by stealth\'\n– Computer Weekly Editors Blog\n- View All Blogs\n\nRelated Content\n\n- McArthurGlen gets tailor-made connectivity and ...\n– ComputerWeekly.com\n- HPE opens shop for retail-ready networks\n– ComputerWeekly.com\n- IT needs to improve network infrastructure for future...\n– ComputerWeekly.com\n\n- CIO\n- Security\n- Networking\n- Data Center\n- Data Management\n\n- How quantum cybersecurity changes the way you protect data\nHere\'s a full guide to the threats quantum computers pose to today\'s encryption algorithms -- and how to prepare now to become "...\n- What are the 4 different types of blockchain technology?\nEach blockchain network has distinct pluses and minuses that largely drive its ideal uses.\n- The 6 different types of quantum computing technology\nTechnology providers offer several paths to the promised land of quantum advantage, but customers must navigate the engineering ...\n\n- IAM compliance: Know the system controls at your disposal\nIAM is critical to an organization\'s data security posture, and its role in regulatory compliance is just as crucial.\n- How to prevent a data breach: 11 best practices and tactics\nWhen it comes to data breach prevention, the stakes are high.

With an interest rate of 8%, we believe we can fund our energy and HPC infrastructure development at a significantly lower cost of capital and with much less dilution than equity funding, creating long-term shareholder value. The net proceeds from the initial $50 million will accelerate the launch of our HPC project at Panther Creek and finance the soft costs as we move forward with the HPC development. Importantly, this valuable partnership with Macquarie provides the necessary capital and expertise in datacenter development to accelerate our next chapter of growth.”\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nKey Financing Terms\n\n- The $300 million project loan is intended to fund the development of the data center project at Panther Creek.\n- The $50 million initial tranche of the facility, which is earmarked for project development soft costs and other general corporate purposes, is at the parent level and is secured by a first priority lien on all assets of the U.S. and Canadian guarantors and the borrower, with customary exclusions. The second tranche of the facility will be for up to $250 million and will be drawable as the Company achieves specific development milestones at its Panther Creek location and upon entering definitive documentation, at which time the entirety of the loan will become secured at the project level only and would result in a total project debt facility of $300 million and termination of the initial loan.\n- The maturity of each facility is two years from the date of closing. Each facility will bear interest at a rate of 8% per annum, with interest on the initial draw of $50 million paid in kind for the first three months.\n- In connection with the initial tranche of the facility, Macquarie will receive warrants for the purchase of $5 million in shares of Bitfarms at a strike price equal to a 25% premium to the average of the past 5 days’ closing price (subject to a minimum strike price floor equal to the last closing price of Bitfarms’ shares on the TSX) and with a tenor of five years. The warrants and underlying shares are subject to customary registration rights for the resale of the underlying shares. Up until $125 million has been drawn under the second tranche of the facility, Macquarie will receive warrants equal to 10% of the amount drawn under the facility at a strike price equal to a 25% premium to the average of the past 5 days’ closing price (subject to a minimum strike price floor equal to the last closing price of Bitfarms’ shares on the TSX prior to grant) with a tenor of five years.\n- The loan agreement for the initial tranche of the facility includes various affirmative and negative covenants for Bitfarms and its subsidiaries, including restrictions on dispositions, dividends, the incurrence of debt and liens, material changes in the nature of its business, related party transactions, and investments, in each case subject to certain customary exclusions and carveouts. In addition, Bitfarms must maintain a minimum of $25 million balance in cash at all times while the initial tranche is outstanding and must deposit additional amounts of cash if the average bitcoin price drops below certain thresholds as provided in the loan agreement (which funds will be returned if the bitcoin price returns to the previous thresholds).\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nNorthland Capital Markets acted as sole placement agent to the Company.

With an interest rate of 8%, we believe we can fund our energy and HPC infrastructure development at a significantly lower cost of capital and with much less dilution than equity funding, creating long-term shareholder value. The net proceeds from the initial $50 million will accelerate the launch of our HPC project at Panther Creek and finance the soft costs as we move forward with the HPC development. Importantly, this valuable partnership with Macquarie provides the necessary capital and expertise in datacenter development to accelerate our next chapter of growth.”\n\nKey Financing Terms\n\n- The $300 million project loan is intended to fund the development of the data center project at Panther Creek.\n- The $50 million initial tranche of the facility, which is earmarked for project development soft costs and other general corporate purposes, is at the parent level and is secured by a first priority lien on all assets of the U.S. and Canadian guarantors and the borrower, with customary exclusions. The second tranche of the facility will be for up to $250 million and will be drawable as the Company achieves specific development milestones at its Panther Creek location and upon entering definitive documentation, at which time the entirety of the loan will become secured at the project level only and would result in a total project debt facility of $300 million and termination of the initial loan.\n- The maturity of each facility is two years from the date of closing. Each facility will bear interest at a rate of 8% per annum, with interest on the initial draw of $50 million paid in kind for the first three months.\n- In connection with the initial tranche of the facility, Macquarie will receive warrants for the purchase of $5 million in shares of Bitfarms at a strike price equal to a 25% premium to the average of the past 5 days’ closing price (subject to a minimum strike price floor equal to the last closing price of Bitfarms’ shares on the TSX) and with a tenor of five years. The warrants and underlying shares are subject to customary registration rights for the resale of the underlying shares. Up until $125 million has been drawn under the second tranche of the facility, Macquarie will receive warrants equal to 10% of the amount drawn under the facility at a strike price equal to a 25% premium to the average of the past 5 days’ closing price (subject to a minimum strike price floor equal to the last closing price of Bitfarms’ shares on the TSX prior to grant) with a tenor of five years.\n- The loan agreement for the initial tranche of the facility includes various affirmative and negative covenants for Bitfarms and its subsidiaries, including restrictions on dispositions, dividends, the incurrence of debt and liens, material changes in the nature of its business, related party transactions, and investments, in each case subject to certain customary exclusions and carveouts. In addition, Bitfarms must maintain a minimum of $25 million balance in cash at all times while the initial tranche is outstanding and must deposit additional amounts of cash if the average bitcoin price drops below certain thresholds as provided in the loan agreement (which funds will be returned if the bitcoin price returns to the previous thresholds).\n\nNorthland Capital Markets acted as sole placement agent to the Company.

The math doesn’t add up—especially when most brands can only realistically manage relationships with an average of 6 retail media networks, according to research from Skai and the Path to Purchase Institute.\n\nAmazon\'s head start in retail media explains part of this imbalance, but there\'s a deeper issue at play: the advertiser experience itself. Brands face a fragmented ecosystem with inconsistent interfaces, workflows, and reporting methodologies across retailers. The result is an increasingly unsustainable environment where smaller networks struggle to compete despite offering valuable, unique audiences.\n\nPart of the solution to these fundamental challenges may lie in a technology that transformed digital advertising over a decade ago but has been slow to take hold in retail media: Real-Time Bidding (RTB).\n\n## Why RTB Matters For Retail Media\n\nReal-Time Bidding represents the backbone of programmatic advertising, allowing for the automated buying and selling of ad impressions in milliseconds. When you visit a news website and see display ads appear almost instantly, you\'re witnessing RTB in action—an entire auction has occurred in the background during page load.\n\nFor retail media, RTB offers transformative potential by addressing three big industry pain points:\n\n1. Fragmentation and Scale: With the proliferation of retail media networks, brands face the impossible task of managing direct relationships with dozens of platforms, each with unique interfaces, metrics, and workflows. RTB creates standardization across networks, allowing advertisers to execute campaigns across multiple retailers through a single platform.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\n### Trump Imposes Tariffs On Uninhabited Heard And McDonald Islands—‘Remotest Places On Earth’\n\n### NYT Mini Today: Hints, Clues And Answers For Thursday, April 3\n\n### 4 Republicans Break With Trump As Senate Rejects His Canada Tariffs\n\n2. Measurement and Transparency: One of advertisers\' biggest frustrations with retail media is inconsistent measurement across platforms. Standardized RTB protocols would enable unified reporting and attribution models.\n\n3. Democratization of Inventory: RTB opens retail media inventory to a broader range of advertisers, increasing competition and potentially improving yield for retailers while providing more options for brands to be seen in the right place at the right time.\n\n## RTB Has Already Transformed Two Other Advertising Ecosystems\n\nThere’s historical precedent for RTB in earlier “eras” of advertising.\n\nReal-Time Bidding (RTB) originally brought standardization to the display advertising landscape by enabling multiple advertisers and publishers to transact across a unified, real-time marketplace, as opposed to making all media buys manually and separately.\n\nThis common protocol, called OpenRTB, was first introduced in 2010 was initially spearheaded by a few ad tech companies and then taken up by the IAB. As of 2023, over 90% of U.S. digital display ad dollars run programmatically, largely powered by RTB.\n\nThe same idea worked for connected TV more recently, where updated standards ("OpenRTB 2.6") let streaming apps and advertisers easily buy and sell video ad spots using the same principles.\n\n## The Technical Challenge of RTB in Retail Media\n\nThe slow adoption of RTB in retail media isn\'t for lack of interest—it\'s because retail environments present unique technical challenges.\n\nWhile RTB is standard in display advertising, retail media has two major hurdles:\n\n1. Latency: Traditional RTB involves communicating with external platforms in real time for each ad request, potentially adding 100+ milliseconds to page load times. In retail, where user experience is directly tied to revenue, this latency can significantly impact conversion rates.\n\n2. Relevance: Unlike content sites where ads can be only tangentially related to surrounding content, retail environments demand highly relevant product ads that match user intent. The algorithm must deliver this relevance in milliseconds.\n\nThese challenges help explain why retail media has largely relied on direct deals and pre-cached bids rather than true real-time auctions. However, advances in technology are beginning to overcome these barriers.\n\nThe value chain of retail media buying with an RTB framework.Kiri Masters | Retail Media Breakfast Club\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The Next Wave: OpenRTB for Retail Media\n\nThe Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) and its IAB Tech Lab have been working to adapt OpenRTB specifications specifically for retail media’s unique requirements. Jeffrey Bustos, a former vice president at the IAB, highlighted this effort in his op-ed for the Path To Purchase Institute, "Democratizing Retail Media Through OpenRTB." Bustos explained how the standard protocol is being tailored to balance the technical demands of programmatic buying with the relevance requirements of retail environments.\n\n"To adapt openRTB for retail, we are fine-tuning our technical specifications to account for retail-specific nuances such as the relevancy of ads to the consumer\'s interests and the retailer\'s product offerings," explained Hillary Slattery, senior director of programmatic product at IAB Tech Lab.\n\nThese improvements make it easier for retailers to share product information in a standard format while still keeping control over how ads appear on their websites. Simply put, retailers can join the programmatic ecosystem without sacrificing their unique shopping experiences.\n\n## Major Platforms Like Microsoft Lead The RTB Charge\n\nMajor advertising platforms recognize the opportunity in standardizing retail media buying. Microsoft, for example, is positioning itself as an aggregation point across retail media networks.\n\n"We’ve really been thinking about how we become an aggregation point across various networks of high-quality retail media supply and then really make it easy to activate a product campaign that runs across those networks in a standardized way," says Lynne Kjolso, VP, Global Partner &amp; Retail Media at Microsoft. "We very much believe that the best way to deliver that kind of advertiser value is going to be in a real-time environment."\n\nMicrosoft aims to extend its existing advertiser relationships—approximately 500,000 advertisers already using their platforms—to retail media supply, enabling a single product campaign to extend across multiple retail environments through RTB technology.\n\nThis presents a compelling proposition for retailers: access to a massive new pool of advertisers without the overhead of building direct relationships. For brands, it promises simplified campaign management across multiple retail properties.\n\nGoogle’s advertising ecosystem is pursuing similar goals, though with different strategic emphasis points. Both technology giants recognize that the future of retail media lies in standardization and scale, which are two benefits that RTB delivers.\n\n## What’s Holding Retailers Back From RTB?\n\nDespite the clear benefits, many retailers remain hesitant to fully embrace RTB. Their concerns generally fall into four categories:\n\n1. Control and Brand Safety: Retailers value tight control over the shopping experience and are wary of letting third-party demand-side platforms directly bid into their on-site inventory. They may fear inappropriate products or messaging could damage customer trust.\n\n2. Premium Inventory and Margins: In retail media, sponsored product placements represent premium inventory with high CPMs or CPCs. Some retailers worry RTB could introduce price competition that reduces average revenue per impression.\n\n3. Data Protection: Retailers\' first-party data—purchase history, loyalty information, browsing behavior—is arguably their most valuable asset. Sharing this data programmatically in real time raises both privacy and strategic concerns.\n\n4. Technical Complexity: Setting up a real-time bidding environment requires significant technical infrastructure—ad server integrations, consent management, fraud detection, and more. Many retailers lack the in-house expertise to implement these systems at scale.\n\n## Looking Ahead To A Real-Time Era\n\nThe evolution of RTB in retail media likely mirrors what we\'ve seen in other advertising sectors. When comparing retail media\'s current state to the progression of RTB in connected TV (CTV), we see striking parallels.\n\nCTV initially faced similar challenges with format standardization, audience fragmentation, and technical implementation barriers. Yet the industry evolved rapidly, with standardization initiatives like OpenRTB 2.6 specifically addressing streaming media’s unique needs.\n\nFor retail media, the path forward will likely include:\n\n1. Standardization Through IAB Leadership: The IAB\'s work on adapting OpenRTB for retail media will create the foundation for wider adoption, reducing technical barriers for retailers.\n\n2. Hybrid Models During Transition: Retailers can begin with hybrid approaches—maintaining direct relationships with top-tier brands while opening secondary inventory to RTB. This balances control with incremental revenue opportunities.\n\n3. Retail Media-Specific RTB Solutions: Specialized technology providers focused solely on the retail media space will emerge with solutions that address the unique challenges of product listing ads and sponsored search within retail environments.\n\n4. Increased Pressure From Advertisers: As brands recognize the efficiency and measurement benefits of standardized RTB across retail media networks, they\'ll increasingly demand this capability from their retail partners.\n\n## The Business Case For Retailers\n\nFor retailers hesitant about embracing RTB, there’s a compelling business case beyond just technical evolution. Microsoft’s Kjolso says that retailers are protective of their first-party data and their inventory, “and I think we need to honor that.” But she adds that the pressures of really intense competition across a very crowded marketplace of RMNs, and the pressure to increasing ‘fill rates’ (the amount of dedicated ad space on on a retailer website that is successfully sold to advertisers) will lead retailers to adopt RTB technology in order to tap into more demand sources like Microsoft, Google, The Trade Desk, and other DSPs.\n\n“Once you’ve launched a retail media program and become a new profit source in the retailer, it’s great,” she says. "But then you have to deliver. You have to deliver ongoing growth. How are they going to do that without taking a step towards evolution?"\n\nThis evolution is perhaps most critical for mid-tier retail media networks. While category leaders like Amazon and Walmart can sustain direct relationships with thousands of brands, smaller networks face an existential challenge: how to compete for advertiser budgets when brands can only manage relationships with six networks at most.\n\n## What This Means For Brands\n\nFor brands, the implications are equally significant. The current fragmented landscape forces marketers to:\n\n1. Manage dozens of separate retail media platforms, each with unique interfaces and workflows\n2. Reconcile inconsistent measurement methodologies across retailers\n3. Make difficult choices about which retail media networks deserve direct investment\n\nRTB promises to alleviate these challenges by bringing retail media buying closer to the efficiency and standardization brands experience in other digital channels. A brand could potentially manage campaigns across numerous retailers through familiar demand-side platforms, with standardized measurement and optimization capabilities.\n\n## Conclusion: Preparing For The Inevitable\n\nThe question is not whether RTB will become standard in retail media, but when and how. The progression we’ve seen in display advertising and connected TV shows that initial resistance gives way to pragmatic adoption as the business benefits become clear.\n\nFor retailers, now is the time to begin planning for this evolution, by assessing current tech infrastructure for RTB readiness. For brands, the opportunity is to advocate for this change with retail partners while preparing internal teams for a more programmatic approach to retail media buying.\n\nThe retail media landscape is maturing rapidly, and RTB represents the next logical step in its evolution. Those who embrace this change early will help shape the standards and practices that define the industry\'s future—and likely gain competitive advantage in the process.\n\n© 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

While traditional interlining has long been essential for global connectivity, it has depended on complex agreements and legacy systems that, though effective, were costly, slow to implement, and inflexible. The new approach builds on this foundation, offering a more adaptable and streamlined alternative.\n\n“Open interlining is about expanding the possibilities and unlocking new tools to build partnerships. Within this toolkit, virtual interlining can be used very strategically to augment traditional interlining agreements,” said Gabor Toth, CEO of TripStack, a Canada-based travel technology company.\n\nSkiftX recently sat down with Toth to learn more about the benefits of open interlining and better understand virtual interlining, an increasingly relevant tool within the broader strategy of open interlining.\n\n## Beyond Traditional Models: The Rise of Open Interlining\n\nInterline partnerships account for a significant portion of airline revenue — over $52 billion annually as of 2019. Yet despite this potential, many airlines avoid interlining altogether due to operational burdens and lack of agility. Even for the airlines with significant interlining agreements, the industry is leaving billions on the table in missed ancillary revenue because traditional interline agreements weren’t designed for a modern retail environment, which prioritizes dynamic pricing, personalized offers, and seamless cross-carrier transactions to enhance both revenue potential and the passenger experience.\n\nAirlines have multiple connectivity options, each with its own advantages and challenges, depending on their business model. Open Interlining takes a holistic approach, considering all pathways as part of a broader strategy. Instead of locking carriers into rigid, all-or-nothing agreements, it allows them to mix and match solutions, ensuring they can implement the most effective approach to meet their goals. Potential pathways include:\n\n- Legacy Interlining: Maintaining traditional agreements where they make sense.\n- Virtual Interlining: Dynamically connecting flights through technology-driven solutions.\n- Offer-and-Order Integration: Transitioning toward modern, seamless retail-driven interactions.\n- Hybrid Models: Combining elements of these approaches to maximize flexibility.\n\n## Blending Legacy and Virtual Interlining\n\nTraditional interlining requires airlines to establish formal agreements, enabling passengers to book flights across multiple carriers as a single itinerary. These partnerships are typically managed through Global Distribution Systems (GDS), which coordinate pricing, ticketing, and payment settlements.\n\nIn contrast, virtual interlining allows travelers to book connecting flights across multiple airlines, even if the carriers have no formal agreements. Using real-time technology, it dynamically assembles itineraries, often offering lower fares and more flexible travel options.\n\n“We ingest billions of price points daily,” Toth said. “Our machine-learning models analyze departure times, layovers, baggage rules, and other variables to generate the most efficient itineraries in real-time.”\n\n## Breaking Down the Barriers to Seamless Connectivity\n\nInterlining in its traditional form is a slow and manual process. Setting up agreements takes months, requires intricate fare mapping, and depends on legacy processes like Billing and Settlement Plan (BSP) and proration, the process of dividing revenue from a multi-airline ticketed itinerary among the participating carriers. Airlines with strong direct-sales models often shy away from interlining because of these operational constraints.\n\nVirtual interlining was the first step toward addressing these inefficiencies. Unlike traditional interline agreements, virtual interlining continues to evolve. It builds itineraries dynamically using real-time pricing, availability, and baggage-handling agreements. Airlines can activate new routes in days instead of months, expanding their networks with minimal overhead.\n\n“Open interlining is about breaking down barriers,” Toth said. “It’s not just about connecting airlines but creating an ecosystem where other modes of transport could also work together to serve travelers better.”\n\n## Real-World Use Cases: How Airlines are Leveraging Open Interlining\n\nThe benefits of open interlining become clear when looking at how different types of airlines use it to their advantage:\n\n- Regional Low-Cost Carriers: Expanding Reach: A European low-cost carrier (LCC) primarily operating within its region can attract global traffic by partnering with international airlines via virtual interlining. For example, by connecting with a South American carrier, the LCC can offer seamless travel between Europe and Brazil without launching its own long-haul routes. This model enables airlines to extend their networks without disrupting their core operations.\n- Long-Haul Airlines: Filling Flights With Feeder Traffic: For long-haul airlines with limited partnerships, virtual interlining offers a way to sell beyond point-to-point itineraries. A transatlantic airline flying from Europe to the U.S. may struggle to attract travelers from smaller regional airports. By tapping into virtual interlining, the airline can seamlessly connect with short-haul carriers, filling seats and increasing profitability.\n- Airline Alliances: Creating Dynamic, Flexible Partnerships: Even airlines in existing alliances can benefit from open interlining. A group of carriers in Asia, for example, may want to collaborate without the restrictions of a formal alliance agreement. Virtual interlining allows them to dynamically adjust partnerships based on shifting market conditions, optimizing routes and improving network reach.\n- Testing New Markets With Minimal Investment: Airlines looking to expand into new regions without the cost of launching direct flights can use open interlining to establish partnerships with local carriers. A European airline with no presence in Southeast Asia, for instance, could use virtual interlining to offer itineraries connecting to the region via partner airlines-allowing it to gauge demand before committing significant resources.\n\n## Unlocking New Revenue Opportunities\n\nBeyond operational efficiency, open interlining presents airlines with new ways to drive revenue and optimize profitability. By shifting away from rigid agreements and legacy systems, carriers can unlock flexible pricing strategies, improve inventory management, and enhance ancillary sales.\n\n“This model allows airlines to test new markets, refine their pricing strategies, and evaluate demand before committing significant resources,” Toth said. “It’s a low-risk way to expand their global footprint.”\n\nAirlines can leverage this model to drive meaningful revenue growth:\n\n- Expanding Market Reach: Low-cost carriers can seamlessly connect with international long-haul partners without committing to complex codeshare agreements, allowing them to form ad hoc partnerships and quickly respond to shifting market conditions.\n- Optimizing Distressed Inventory: Airlines can use dynamic pricing to move unsold seats by offering them through virtual interlining, reducing the risk of empty seats while maximizing yield.\n- Enhancing Ancillary Sales: More flexible interlining means better integration of baggage fees, seat upgrades, and other high-margin add-ons, allowing airlines to package these seamlessly into a single itinerary to increase overall revenue per passenger.\n- Testing New Routes Without Risk: Airlines can assess demand for a market before launching direct flights, using virtual interlining as a low-cost alternative to committing significant resources to new routes.\n- Reducing Dependency on GDS: By shifting to NDC and offer and order, airlines can retain more control over pricing, distribution, and settlement, reducing third-party costs and increasing flexibility in bundling and fare management.\n\n## The Move to Open Interline Is Underway\n\nAs the airline industry evolves, traditional interline agreements are no longer enough to meet shifting consumer expectations and operational demands. By rethinking interline strategies today, airlines can future-proof their partnerships, improve the passenger experience, and maximize profitability in an evolving marketplace.\n\nTo explore the benefits of open interlining and learn more about partnering with TripStack, click here. \n\nThis content was created collaboratively by TripStack and Skift’s branded content studio, SkiftX.\n\n- Share\n- LinkedIn icon\n- Twitter icon\n- facebook icon\n- Mail icon\n\nSponsored By\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nApril 2nd, 2025 at 6:00 AM EDT\n\nTags: SkiftX Creative Studio, SkiftX Showcase: Aviation, SkiftX Showcase: Technology, TripStack\n\nPhoto Credit: TripStack\n\n## Up Next\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n### How Travel Brands Can Seize the ‘Q5’ Opportunity on TikTok\n\nDriven by increased spending on experiences and the digital habits of younger audiences, TikTok has emerged as a key platform for inspiring and shaping travel decisions.

Over the years, I’ve seen three key trends pushing automation forward:\n\n• Rise Of Autonomous Shopping: Customers expect self-service options that reduce wait times and eliminate checkout hassles.\n\n• Data-Driven Decisions: AI-powered insights are helping retailers predict demand, reduce stockouts and optimize layouts.\n\n• Accurate Inventory Management: Advanced weight sensors and shelf cameras prevent shrinkage and misclassification, ensuring real-time tracking.\n\n## Inside The Autonomous Store Architecture\n\nBuilding a fully autonomous checkout store isn’t just about removing cashiers—it’s about creating a system where every product movement is tracked in real time. Let’s break down the key components that make this possible.\n\n• Tracking Sensors: We use AI-driven sensors to analyze customer movement and product interactions, helping retailers optimize store layouts based on foot traffic patterns.\n\n• Weight Sensors: Installed on shelves, these detect when an item is picked up or returned, ensuring precise stock updates and billing accuracy.\n\n• Shelf Cameras: These prevent product misclassification and enhance security by using image recognition to monitor shelf activity.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges I’ve encountered is integrating these technologies into existing store infrastructures without major disruptions. A loosely coupled architecture can help you tackle this problem by keeping systems modular, so updates and new features can be deployed without costly overhauls.\n\n## Lessons From Real-World Deployments\n\nThrough our journey, we’ve helped retailers transition from traditional stores to frictionless, AI-powered shopping environments. Here are a few insights I’ve gained along the way.\n\n• The Biggest Integration Challenge: One challenge we often face is syncing AI-powered inventory tracking with traditional POS systems. One solution is a hybrid model that allows gradual adoption without disrupting current operations.\n\n• Advice For Retailers Adopting Autonomous Checkout: Start small—pilot in high-traffic zones before rolling out full automation. This allows you to test, optimize and refine based on real-time insights.\n\n• Biggest Surprise In This Journey: When we first started, we assumed customers might be hesitant about a completely cashier-less experience. The reality? We found that adoption rates skyrocketed because of the seamless experience and faster checkout process.\n\n## Why Loosely Coupled Architecture Is A Game Changer\n\nThe biggest advantage of this approach is flexibility. Retail is evolving fast, and technology should evolve with it. A loosely coupled design ensures:\n\n• Scalability: Need to add new AI-powered cameras? No problem. The system can integrate upgrades without downtime.\n\n• Customizability: Every retailer has unique needs. A loosely coupled architecture allows tailored AI models for different store formats.\n\n• Rapid Market Deployment: Test, tweak and deploy without disrupting operations, which is a must for retailers navigating shifting customer expectations.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nAutonomous checkout isn’t just a futuristic concept—it’s happening right now. As retailers, embracing AI-powered solutions isn’t just about keeping up with trends; it’s about staying ahead.\n\nIf you’re considering adopting autonomous checkout, now is the time to start.

In 2023, a significant shift toward e-commerce was evident as 70% of EU inhabitants between the ages of 16 and 74 made purchases online. Click &amp; Collect and other flexible, convenient shopping solutions are in high demand due to this trend. As more customers choose to buy for groceries online and as digital platforms and mobile apps advance, Click &amp; Collect services are becoming a vital component of the European retail scene.\n\nChallenges in the Europe Click &amp; Collect Grocery Market\n\nLogistical complexities\n\nA major obstacle to the Click &amp; Collect food business in Europe is logistical complexity. Retailers may find it challenging to effectively manage inventory across several sites and guarantee real-time product availability. Pressure is increased when order fulfillment is coordinated to guarantee that orders are precisely selected and prepared on schedule. Additionally, careful planning is necessary to handle perishable commodities at pick-up locations without sacrificing quality, freshness, or safety. These logistical challenges may raise operating expenses and make it more difficult to provide Click &amp; Collect services efficiently.\n\nHigh Operational Costs\n\nAnother major issue facing the European Click &amp; Collect grocery business is operational costs. In order to handle orders, retailers need to make investments in infrastructure, such as designated pick-up locations, storage spaces, and employees. It also takes money to keep up with effective inventory management systems and order tracking technology. Overheads are further increased by labor costs related to order picking, packaging, and quality control. For many merchants in the area, balancing these expenses while maintaining profitability continues to be a major challenge as the demand for Click &amp; Collect services increases.\n\nGermany Click &amp; Collect Grocery Market\n\nThe click-and-collect food business in Germany is expanding steadily due to rising online and convenience shopping demand. In 2024, 27.7% of Germans are anticipated to utilize Click &amp; Collect grocery services, up from 23.4% in 2020, according to eMarketer. This increase is indicative of consumers\' increasing need for flexible shopping options, particularly in cities. To match customer expectations, retailers are increasing the number of pick-up locations and investing in effective order fulfillment technologies. Technological developments are also helping the business by facilitating smooth online purchasing and better logistics, which increases its attractiveness to German customers.\n\nUnited Kingdom Click &amp; Collect Grocery Market\n\nThe market for click-and-collect groceries in the UK has grown significantly due to shifting consumer demands for convenience. Click &amp; Collect fulfilled more than 15% of UK e-commerce sales in 2023, which is almost twice as much as the pre-pandemic share of 8% in 2019. This increase is indicative of a move toward hybrid shopping patterns, in which customers choose to pick up their food in-store even while they place online orders. As the market continues to grow due to better technology and more convenient pick-up alternatives, retailers are increasing their Click &amp; Collect infrastructure to match the increasing demand.\n\nFrance Click &amp; Collect Grocery Market\n\nThe increasing use of e-commerce is driving the rapid growth of the Click &amp; Collect grocery sector in France. It is anticipated that 51.5 million people in France would utilize e-commerce, with user penetration rising from 74% in 2021 to 78% during the next five years. As more customers look for flexible ways to order and pick up groceries, this trend increases demand for easy shopping solutions like Click &amp; Collect. To meet this growing demand, retailers are improving their offerings with more effective pick-up locations and improved technologies.\n\nKey Attributes:\n\n| Report Attribute                      | Details         |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| No. of Pages                          | 200             |\n| Forecast Period                       | 2024 - 2033     |\n| Estimated Market Value (USD) in 2024  | $46.51 Billion  |\n| Forecasted Market Value (USD) by 2033 | $276.39 Billion |\n| Compound Annual Growth Rate           | 22.0%           |\n| Regions Covered                       | Europe          |\n\nCompany Covered: Overview, Recent Development &amp; Strategies, Revenue Analysis\n\n- Tesco Plc.\n- ICA Gruppen AB\n- Auchan SA\n- Colruyt Group\n- Carrefour\n- Costco Wholesale Corporation\n- Koninklijke Ahold Delhaize N.V.\n- J Sainsbury plc\n\nKey Topics Covered: \n\n1.

Their widespread adoption highlights their enormous utility and exposes their limitations in making domain-specific business decisions beyond text generation.\n- While LLMs generate coherent text, they lack a native understanding of business rules, regulatory policies, and operational constraints. This makes them insufficient for real-world decision-making processes that require structured optimization beyond language synthesis.\n- Techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or fine-tuning an LLM can steer outputs to a certain limit. Still, they cannot encode business-specific constraints or generate structured, executable strategies as effectively as a domain-specific generative model.\n- As image-based generative models generate images instead of text, domain-specific generative models can be trained to learn operational constraints and develop optimal business strategies, offering structured decision-making capabilities beyond descriptive outputs.\n- Unlike general-purpose LLMs, domain-specific models require significantly smaller datasets and fewer parameters, making them cost-effective and computationally feasible while enabling automation and AI-driven core business decision intelligence at scale.\n\nThe advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT has revolutionized industries by enabling text-based automation, thanks to their amazing text-generation capabilities. However, true business value goes beyond just text generation.\n\nA recent Boston Consulting Group (BCG) report\\(^1\\) highlights that 62% of the value generated by AI across industries comes from core business functions such as supply chain, operations, and revenue-generating processes. Only 38% comes from support functions like customer service. It further states that, out of all the organizations engaging with AI, only 26% have managed to go beyond the Proof of Concept (PoC) stage. Of this, just 4% generate cutting-edge value consistently.\n\nWhat sets these leaders apart? The report highlights that successful organizations invest 70% of their AI transformation effort in \'People and Processes\' compared to only 20% in technology and 10% in algorithms. This strategic focus allows them to align AI initiatives closely with their core business processes, facilitating new revenue streams alongside productivity improvements. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved customer service interactions and content generation, they inherently lack the capability to understand domain-specific constraints and business rules, creating a clear barrier for embedding AI deeply into operational decision-making.\n\n#### Related Sponsored Content\n\nEven advanced approaches like Agentic AI built on top of Large Language Models (LLMs) primarily achieve workflow orchestration through text-based chain-of-thought prompting. However, it remains at the text level without embedding any domain-specific business knowledge.\n\nTherefore, to truly integrate AI with core business processes, LLMs alone are not sufficient, and industries (such as logistics, finance, and utilities) require AI that generates optimal, actionable, decision-driven output under real-time conditions and constraints rather than descriptive text. For instance:\n\n- A logistics firm does not need an AI model to describe how to optimize routes. Instead, given current conditions, it needs an AI model capable of generating optimized route schedules.\n- A utility company does not need an LLM to summarize grid restoration plans. Rather, it requires an AI that is able to produce executable restoration sequences in real time, considering current weather, location, crew availability, safety norms, and company policies.\n\nThis article explores and proposes a shift from text-based AI to domain-specific Generative AI, models that understand operational constraints, real-world dynamics, and business rules to generate executable strategies, not just text descriptions.\n\n## Current Generative AI Landscape\n\nGenerative AI has come a long way since its first public adoption, driven by rapid technological advancement and increasing financial investments. The Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024 makes this trend clear beyond doubt. The report states that 149 new foundational models were released in 2023 alone, more than double the number in 2022. It goes on to say that the number of AI Patent grants from 2021 to 2022 skyrocketed by 62.7% and that the number of AI-related projects on GitHub has gone from 845 in 2011 to about 1.8 million in 2023\\(^2\\). On the financial investments side, funding for Generative AI in 2023 surged to $25.2 billion, nearly 8 times from 2022\\(^2\\). This growing influx of capital underscores the growing industry confidence in the commercial potential and capabilities of Generative AI.\n\nDelving deeper into this landscape, out of the 149 new foundational models released in 2023, about 65.7% were open source, reflecting a significant shift towards a larger open-source footprint and democratization of Generative AI model development. However, the highest-performing models, such as OpenAI\'s GPT-4 and Google\'s Gemini Ultra, reflecting the latest state-of-the-art, remained proprietary, closed-source industry-driven systems, with Gemini Ultra achieving human-level performance milestones on the Massive Multitasking Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark.\n\nThis landscape indicates Generative AI\'s rapidly growing maturity. It also highlights the growing industry footprint of Generative AI as it becomes more accessible and advanced. However, the same \'Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024\'\\(^2\\) also points out that the computation cost of training frontier models has risen steeply. For example, GPT-4’s training cost soared to $78 million, while Gemini Ultra’s cost was an unprecedented $191 million.\n\nAs a result, most industry players are restricted to drawing value from orchestration over general-purpose LLMs and image models trained by a few AI players with the means and resources to do so at a large scale. Not that this pattern has any less value, but these general-purpose models excel primarily in text/image generation and general reasoning tasks, leaving a gap in the area of domain-specific generative models that could be engineered from the ground up to produce structured, actionable, and optimized business decisions in real-time.\n\n## LLMs Vs Domain-Specific Generative Models\n\nSo, what is the difference between LLMs and Domain-Specific Generative Models?\n\nLLMs like GPT-4 are autoregressive models based on the Transformer architecture, first described by Vaswani et al. (2017)\\(^3\\), generating outputs by sequentially predicting the next token(s) conditioned on the preceding context. Transformers rely on self-attention mechanisms that allow the model to weigh different words relative to each other when generating text. During training, an LLM processes vast quantities of textual data to learn an approximate probability distribution (representing a space from which the observed training data could be sampled, with the highest possible likelihood).\n\nOnce trained, the model generates text by sequential sampling from this learned distribution based on the provided input text. This is why LLMs are remarkably effective in tasks involving natural language, such as translations, conversational interactions, summarization, etc. However, this kind of output only reflects learned statistical patterns of textual data, lacking explicit understanding of domain-specific rules or relationships. The architecture below is based on principles from Vaswani et al. (2017)\\(^3\\) and Radford et al. (2019)\\(^4\\).\n\nFigure 1: A generalized representation of Transformer-based LLM architecture inspired by Vaswani et al. (2017) and Radford et al. (2019)\n\nBy contrast, Domain-Specific Generative Models can be designed to explicitly learn from structured, operational data unique to a particular business domain, embedding domain rules and constraints directly into their generative process. Similarly to LLMs, they can be trained using the autoregressive principle followed by some optimization techniques like GFlowNet\\(^5\\).\n\nStill, unlike general-purpose LLMs, they do not merely reproduce statistically plausible text. Instead, they generate executable, decision-driven outputs tailored to real-time business conditions and constraints. This makes them uniquely suitable for integration into operational workflows, where reliable, structured, and actionable outputs, rather than descriptive text, are essential.\n\n### Under the Hood: Brief Introduction to Autoregressive Generative Models\n\nAutoregressive generative models are probabilistic models that generate outputs sequentially by sampling from a joint probability distribution, where each step is conditioned on all the previous events. This joint probability distribution is learned during offline training, using observed real-world event sequences as data points.\n\nDuring training, the model assigns conditional probabilities across the event space, adjusting its parameters such that historically observed events (actual data points) receive the highest likelihood under the learned distribution. These models are widely used in applications where structured dependencies matter, such as natural language processing, time-series forecasting, and, in our case, strategic decision-making.\n\nIn summary, the Autoregressive process estimates the joint probability of an event sequence X as:\n\n\\(P(X) = p(x\\_1) p(x\\_2 \\mid x\\_1) p(x\\_3 \\mid x\\_1, x\\_2) \\dots p(x\\_d \\mid x\\_1, x\\_2, \\dots, x\\_{d-1}) \\)\n\nWhere:\n\n- X is a feature vector consisting of individual features.\n- \\(x\\_1, x\\_2, x\\_3, \\dots, x\\_{d-1}, x\\_d\\) are individual features representing business events.\n\nThis means the model learns how each step influences the next, making it well-suited for generating structured, decision-driven sequences, whether textual or non-textual data.\n\nFigure 2: An ideal Auto-Regressive Process\n\nWhy not Just Use LLMs?\n\nLLMs are autoregressive models trained on vast text corpora, making them powerful for text generation but not inherently suited for business decision modeling. An LLM simply produces highly probable text sequences based on its training data.\n\nBy contrast, a domain-specific autoregressive model can be trained on structured historical business data such as supply chain events or logistics optimizations. As a result, instead of generating the next highest probability word in a sentence, a domain-specific model would sample the next highest probability decision in a business process from its learned probability distribution incorporating business constraints and operational metrics.\n\nEmbedding Domain Constraints\n\nUnlike generic autoregressive models, domain-specific models incorporate constraints directly into training, ensuring generated sequences comply with operational, security, and regulatory policies. These constraints can be:\n\n- Hard Constraints: Fixed rules (e.g., delivery deadlines, compliance &amp; regulations).\n- Soft Constraints: Optimizable objectives (e.g., minimizing cost, maximizing efficiency).\n\nBy learning from structured domain-specific event sequences rather than generic text, this approach allows businesses to automate strategic decision-making at scale, moving beyond LLM-based workflow orchestration to truly embedded AI-driven operations.\n\nWhat happens if the real-world data is suboptimal?\n\nA key challenge in training domain-specific autoregressive models is that real-world data is often suboptimal. The learned probability distribution will naturally optimize to replicate patterns observed in the dataset. Still, if historical business decisions were inefficient or constrained by past limitations, the model will inherently generate similarly suboptimal outputs. This is precisely why we required this domain-specific approach in the first place - to optimize existing suboptimal core business processes.\n\nFor this reason, training should combine an autoregressive learning process with a reward-based optimization loop (such as GFlowNet)\\(^5\\). This ensures that the model is nudged towards sequences that maximize specific business objectives instead of blindly replicating past behaviors.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Logistics Routing :\n    - Problem: Historical supply chain data may show suboptimal delivery schedules, where shipments were frequently delayed due to poor route selection or fixed scheduling rules instead of adapting to real-time traffic, weather, or fleet conditions.\n    - Solution: First, the model learns from past data, but then it optimizes routes by maximizing a reward function to minimize delivery time, reduce costs, and balance fleet load.\n- Retail Demand Forecasting &amp; Inventory Allocation :\n    - Problem: Due to rigid replenishment rules, a retailer’s historical inventory decisions might reflect overstocking in low-demand areas or understocking in high-demand locations.\n    - Solution: The model initially learns from past replenishment data but re-weights its probability distribution based on dynamic factors (seasonality, competitor pricing, and foot traffic data) to generate adaptive, revenue-optimized restocking plans.\n\nBy iteratively refining the learned distribution with optimal sequences, businesses can move from descriptive AI (mimicking past decisions) to prescriptive AI (actively improving decision-making)\\(^6\\).\n\n## Shifting from Text to Model-Native Action: Core Differences\n\nWhile LLMs have revolutionized AI adoption, their reliance on text-based probability distributions makes integrating them into structured decision-making processes difficult. This is why 74% of organizations fail to go beyond the proof-of-concept (PoC) stage. Their AI adoption stops at generating descriptive text rather than producing structured, executable business actions. This is not to deny the enormous credit that LLMs rightly get for triggering the current AI transformations. However, they are more difficult to fully and seamlessly integrate with core business processes than domain-specific generative AI. Let\'s examine this claim to investigate the core differences.\n\nLLMs are trained to generate text by modeling the statistical likelihood of word sequences from vast datasets. They do not inherently understand business logic, constraints, or real-world operations. LLMs merely generate text that is statistically probable based on prior text corpora. This makes them ill-suited for decision-driven business processes like logistics, finance, or energy optimization. This model simply samples text from this learned probability distribution conditioned on the user-provided input text. In order to adapt a model like this to the core business process of a logistics company (e.g., the constraints and policies governing decisions about a route plan), one must do the following:\n\n1. Provide the model with a textual knowledge base (that it can potentially store in memory) detailing a map of shipping hubs, company policies, various countries\' specific rules, etc.\n2. Use prompt engineering with system prompts to lead the model in generating instructions for the route plan.\n\nThe model can then provide a meaningful and coherent text description of how to run a route plan, but it does not understand the real business rules. The result is not reliable, repeatable, or easily integrated with existing business processes.\n\nUnlike LLMs, domain-specific generative models are trained directly on structured, real-world business decisions. Instead of merely generating plausible text, these models learn how business constraints, such as logistics rules, compliance policies, cost structures, and risk factors, affect operational strategies. This training makes models inherently better-suited for structured decision-making and real-time execution than LLMs, which require extensive prompt engineering and external filtering. This direct training of models leads to minimizing shipping time, maximizing security, minimizing cost, and so on. An agent framework built on top of this model will integrate seamlessly with the company\'s core business process as it generates optimized, executable route plans.\n\n## Key Architectural Principles\n\nThis section outlines the core architectural principles required to build and integrate domain-specific generative AI models into enterprise systems. The architecture consists of two primary components:\n\n- Offline Training Architecture – Learning from structured historical business event sequences.\n- Online Sampling and Generation – Generating real-time, optimized decision strategies.\n\n1. Offline Training: Learning from Historical Business Data\n\n- The offline training pipeline is designed to capture historical business event sequences and transform them into learned probability distributions using Autoregressive Neural Networks followed by GFlowNet or Reinforcement Learning (RL) optimization.\n- Enterprise Data Collection: Business events from various transactional systems (e.g., order management, operations, pricing, logistics, etc.) are captured using event-driven mechanisms such as Kafka streaming pipelines.\n- Feature Engineering &amp; Encoding: Events are transformed, aggregated, cleansed, and vectorized before being stored as structured datasets.\n- Constraint Integration: Business constraints, security policies, and organizational constraints are dynamically fetched and encoded into the feature space.\n- Model Training Process:\n    - Autoregressive Probability Modeling: The first stage models the probability distribution P(X) of sequential decision-making events using a Neural Autoregressive Estimator.\n    - Optimization using GFlowNet: The second stage optimizes the learned probability distribution to yield an optimized distribution P(X\'), adjusting it to favor optimal strategies through reward-based fine-tuning.\n- Versioned Training Pipeline: The model undergoes scheduled re-training on newly available business events, ensuring it stays current.\n\nThe trained model at the end of this pipeline represents a learned, domain-specific probability distribution, capturing decision patterns that can be sampled in real time.\n\nFigure 3: Offline Training &amp; Deployment\n\n[Click here to expand image above to full-size]\n\n2. Online Sampling: Generating Optimal Decision Sequences\n\nOnce trained, the model is deployed into a real-time enterprise workflow to dynamically generate optimized strategies and decision sequences.\n\n- Event-Driven Architecture: Live transactional business events (e.g., warehouse routing updates, logistics route planning, pricing fluctuations) continuously stream into an enterprise event hub (Kafka Platform).\n- Agentic AI API Layer: This layer interacts with external systems, receiving real-time business inputs and fetching necessary constraints (security policies, regulatory norms, custom business rules).\n- Business Events Encoding: The incoming transactional events are encoded into feature vectors before being used as input for inference.\n- Generative AI Model Execution:\n    - Autoregressive Sampling: The foundational autoregressive model samples from P(X), generating an initial decision sequence.\n    - GFlowNet or RL-Based Refinement: The policy optimization network further refines these outputs, ensuring decisions align with business goals (e.g., cost minimization, efficiency maximization).\n- Decision Deployment &amp; Execution: The generated optimized decision strategy is sent back into business systems (e.g., routing systems in logistics, pricing adjustments in e-commerce, restoration strategies in energy utilities).\n\nFigure 4: Online Sampling and Output\n\n[Click here to expand image above to full-size]\n\n## Implementation Challenges\n\nDeveloping domain-specific AI is not without its unique challenges. These difficulties arise from data availability, model complexity, and deployment constraints. Let\'s examine each one.\n\n1. Data Availability: Many industry players have historically not designed their systems to collect and retain data, let alone the high-quality data required to create feature vectors representing sequences of business events to train AI models. The situation worsens when we observe that most industry players have less than optimal implementations of enterprise-wide source-of-truth data models. This means that business data is fragmented in many systems that work in silos and do not understand each other\'s data models. For example, the CRM system within an enterprise may be completely disconnected from the ERP system, which does not correlate with the billing system and so on. Although AI models should be able to learn correlation from raw data from each of these systems, a minimum level of correlation is needed to create the feature vectors required for training.\n2. Model Complexity: Domain-specific generative models must do more than generate plausible outputs. They must understand and enforce business rules, constraints, and industry-specific policies. For example, some rules (e.g., regulatory compliance) must be strictly enforced, while others (e.g., cost-efficiency trade-offs) require flexible optimization. Similarly, the model must balance competing objectives, such as simultaneously optimizing for speed, cost, and compliance. Also, unlike LLMs that generate free-form text, decision-generating models must produce structured, executable outputs aligned with business workflows.\n3. Deployment: Deployments are challenging because the model deployment requires an offline version to train the model and an online version that samples real-time transactional business inputs from the learned model. This increases the deployment\'s complexity and makes the team constitution more complex because now you need data scientists and AI engineers collaborating with the application development teams. Deployments also put pressure on the enterprise recruitment process. Many industries rely on decades-old IT infrastructure that cannot natively integrate AI-driven decision-making, and deployments must still deal with this situation. Lastly, since operational strategies and business decision-making involve AI, there must be some way of continuously auditing and verifying the correctness of AI-generated outputs. This is very challenging when it comes to semi-automated processes with human involvement.\n\n## Future Outlook and ROI\n\nAs organizations increasingly seek AI-driven transformation beyond text-based automation, domain-specific generative models are poised to become the next major leap in AI adoption. This shift extends beyond cost reduction, offering opportunities for core business process transformation, new revenue-generating innovations, operational excellence, and scalability across industries.\n\n1. Scalability across domains: While we focused on the logistics and supply business domain, the same foundational approach can be applied to numerous industries where decision-making involves structured, sequential processes.\n    - Healthcare: Optimizing hospital resource allocation, patient scheduling, and clinical workflow automation.\n    - Manufacturing: AI-driven supply chain coordination and production scheduling.\n    - Finance: Enhancing fraud detection, credit risk assessment, and algorithmic trading strategies.\n    - Retail: AI-powered inventory management, personalized promotions, and dynamic pricing strategies.\n2. Operational Excellence: Unlike traditional analytics tools, which rely on rule-based systems, domain-specific generative AI models can drive continuous, adaptive optimization. For example, a pharmaceutical company could use a domain-specific model to optimize drug production schedules based on raw material availability, regulatory constraints, and global demand forecasts, achieving faster time-to-market while minimizing waste.\n3. Strong Return on Investment (ROI), with lower training costs: One of the strongest advantages of domain-specific generative AI is that it does not require the massive computational resources needed to train large LLMs like GPT or Claude. Why domain-specific models are likely to deliver strong ROI -\n    - Smaller, More Targeted Models: Unlike LLMs that require training on trillions of tokens, domain-specific models can be trained on proprietary, industry-specific data, reducing compute requirements.\n    - More Precision: Training is narrowly focused on business constraints and operational strategies, meaning it is feasible to achieve high accuracy.\n    - Faster Time to Value: Since these models don’t need to be generalized across multiple domains, enterprises can deploy them faster and start seeing business impact sooner.\n    - Ongoing Optimization: Unlike LLMs, which often require expensive retraining, domain-specific models can be incrementally updated with new business data, keeping costs lower over time.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has reshaped AI’s role in business, but true AI-driven transformation requires models that go beyond generating text. To fully unlock AI’s business value, enterprises must shift toward strategy-based AI models that can learn from domain-specific historical data, embed constraints, and generate optimal, actionable decisions rather than just text descriptions.\n\nThis article introduced a new perspective: Agentic AI is not limited to text-based workflows. While LLMs can power automation through prompt-driven orchestration, domain-specific generative models offer direct integration with core business processes. These models are uniquely suited to industries where real-time decision-making, operational constraints, and domain expertise play a crucial role, such as logistics, finance, healthcare, and beyond. As AI leaders, researchers, and business decision-makers, we need to decide:\n\n- Will AI remain an assistive tool that is limited to automating support functions?\n- Or will AI evolve into an engine for decision-making, driving industry-specific intelligence and business transformation?\n\nIt’s time for enterprises to reimagine AI as an active decision-maker rather than just a language-based assistant. Industry leaders and AI researchers must collaborate to shape the future of AI-driven decision intelligence, one in which we can use AI for core business process transformations at scale.\n\n## References\n\n\\(^1\\)\xa0Nicolas de Bellefonds, Tauseef Charanya, \xa0Marc Roman Franke, \xa0Jessica Apotheker, \xa0Patrick Forth, \xa0Michael Grebe, \xa0Amanda Luther, \xa0Romain de Laubier, \xa0Vladimir Lukic, \xa0Mary Martin, Clemens Nopp, and Joe Sassine, "Where’s the Value in AI?".\n\n\\(^2\\)\xa0Nestor Maslej, Loredana Fattorini, Raymond Perrault, Vanessa Parli, Anka Reuel, Erik Brynjolfsson, John Etchemendy, Katrina Ligett, Terah Lyons, James Manyika, Juan Carlos Niebles, Yoav Shoham, Russell Wald, and Jack Clark, "The AI Index 2024 Annual Report", AI Index Steering Committee, Institute for Human-Centered AI, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, April 2024.\n\n\\(^3\\)\xa0Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit, Llion Jones, Aidan N.

The vulnerability is a privilege escalation vulnerability that impacts the Core Media framework. The Apple Core Media framework supports multimedia tasks like playback, recording, and manipulation of audio and video on iOS and macOS devices. The company addressed the use-after-free issue with improved memory management.\n\n- CVE-2025-24200\xa0(CVSS score: 4.6) – In February, Apple released emergency security updates to address a zero-day vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-24200, that the company believes was exploited in “extremely sophisticated” targeted attacks. An attacker could have exploited the vulnerability to disable the USB Restricted Mode “on a locked device.” Apple’s\xa0USB Restricted Mode\xa0is a security feature introduced in iOS 11.4.1 to protect devices from unauthorized access via the Lightning port. The USB Restricted Mode disables the data connection of the iPhone’s Lightning port after a specific\xa0interval of\xa0time, but it doesn’t interrupt the charging process. Any other data transfer\xa0would require the user to provide the passcode. The IT giant fixed the vulnerability with improved state management.\n\n- CVE-2025-24201\xa0(CVSS score: 8.8) – In March, Apple released emergency security updates to address a zero-day vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-24201, in the WebKit cross-platform web browser engine. The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write issue that was exploited in “extremely sophisticated” attacks. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability using maliciously crafted web content to escape the Web Content sandbox. Apple released this fix as an additional measure after blocking a similar attack in iOS 17.2.\n\nApple released the following updates:\n\n- CVE-2025-24085 –\xa0macOS Sonoma 14.7.5,\xa0macOS Ventura 13.7.5, and\xa0iPadOS 17.7.6\n- CVE-2025-24200 –\xa0iOS 15.8.4, iPadOS 15.8.4,\xa0iOS 16.7.11, and iPadOS 16.7.11\n- CVE-2025-24201 –\xa0iOS 15.8.4, iPadOS 15.8.4,\xa0iOS 16.7.11, and iPadOS 16.7.11\n\nthat are available for the following devices:\n\n- iOS 15.8.4 and iPadOS 15.8.4 – iPhone 6s (all models), iPhone 7 (all models), iPhone SE (1st generation), iPad Air 2, iPad mini (4th generation), and iPod touch (7th generation)\n- iOS 16.7.11 and iPadOS 16.7.11 – iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPad 5th generation, iPad Pro 9.7-inch, and iPad Pro 12.9-inch 1st generation\n- iPadOS 17.7.6 – iPad Pro 12.9-inch 2nd generation, iPad Pro 10.5-inch, and iPad 6th generation\n\nFollow me on Twitter:\xa0@securityaffairs\xa0and\xa0Facebook\xa0and\xa0Mastodon\n\nPierluigi\xa0Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs\xa0–\xa0hacking,\xa0newsletter)\n\n#### you might also like\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n##### New Triada Trojan comes preinstalled on Android devices\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n##### New advanced FIN7\'s Anubis backdoor allows to gain full system control on Windows\n\n#### leave a comment\n\n#### newsletter\n\n###### Subscribe to my email list and stay\n up-to-date!\n\n#### recent articles\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n###### New Triada Trojan comes preinstalled on Android devices\n\nMalware / April 03, 2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n###### New advanced FIN7\'s Anubis backdoor allows to gain full system control on Windows\n\nMalware / April 02, 2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n###### U.S. CISA adds Apache Tomcat flaw to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog\n\nSecurity / April 02, 2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n###### Apple backported fixes for three actively exploited flaws to older devices\n\nSecurity / April 02, 2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n###### Spike in Palo Alto Networks scanner activity suggests imminent cyber threats\n\nHacking / April 02, 2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo contact me write an email to:\n\n\n                            Pierluigi Paganini : \n\n[email\xa0protected]\n\n#### QUICK LINKS\n\n- Home\n- Cyber Crime\n- Cyber warfare\n- APT\n- Data Breach\n- Deep Web\n- Digital ID\n- Hacking\n- Hacktivism\n- Intelligence\n- Internet of Things\n- Laws and regulations\n- Malware\n- Mobile\n- Reports\n- Security\n- Social Networks\n- Terrorism\n- ICS-SCADA\n- POLICIES\n- Contact me\n\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2024\n\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

From March 17 to 26, activity surged with nearly 20,000 IPs scanning logins daily. GreyNoise identified around 23,000 suspicious IPs and 150 known malicious ones, suggesting a potential targeted attack.\n\n“GreyNoise has observed a significant surge in login scanning activity targeting Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS GlobalProtect portals. Over the last 30 days,\xa0nearly 24,000 unique IP addresses have attempted to access these portals.” reads the report published by GreyNoise.\xa0“The pattern suggests a coordinated effort to probe network defenses and identify exposed or vulnerable systems, potentially as a precursor to targeted exploitation.”\n\nThe experts believe that this activity is part of a reconnaissance effort to test network defenses, potentially paving the way for future attacks.\xa0GreyNoise recommends that organizations using Palo Alto Networks products should take steps to secure their login portals.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA large portion of traffic is linked to 3xK Tech GmbH (20,010 IPs) under ASN200373, with contributions from PureVoltage Hosting Inc., Fast Servers Pty Ltd., and Oy Crea Nova Hosting. GreyNoise identified three JA4h hashes related to a login scanner tool. The activity originates mainly from the U.S. (16,249 IPs) and Canada (5,823 IPs), targeting primarily the U.S. (23,768), followed by the U.K., Ireland, Russia, and Singapore.\n\nThe researchers also observed scans that are targeting GlobalProtect portals and other PAN-OS appliances like PAN-OS Crawler, similar to threats identified by Cisco Talos in April last year, which targeted Cisco appliances, Microsoft Exchange servers, and edge devices from various vendors.\n\n“Given the unusual nature of this activity, organizations with exposed Palo Alto Networks systems should review their March logs and\xa0consider performing a detailed threat hunt on running systems to identify any signs of compromise.” GreyNoise concludes.\n\nFollow me on Twitter:\xa0@securityaffairs\xa0and\xa0Facebook\xa0and\xa0Mastodon\n\nPierluigi\xa0Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs\xa0–\xa0hacking,\xa0GreyNoise)\n\n#### you might also like\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n##### New Triada Trojan comes preinstalled on Android devices\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n##### New advanced FIN7\'s Anubis backdoor allows to gain full system control on Windows\n\n#### leave a comment\n\n#### newsletter\n\n###### Subscribe to my email list and stay\n up-to-date!\n\n#### recent articles\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n###### New Triada Trojan comes preinstalled on Android devices\n\nMalware / April 03, 2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n###### New advanced FIN7\'s Anubis backdoor allows to gain full system control on Windows\n\nMalware / April 02, 2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n###### U.S. CISA adds Apache Tomcat flaw to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog\n\nSecurity / April 02, 2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n###### Apple backported fixes for three actively exploited flaws to older devices\n\nSecurity / April 02, 2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n###### Spike in Palo Alto Networks scanner activity suggests imminent cyber threats\n\nHacking / April 02, 2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo contact me write an email to:\n\n\n                            Pierluigi Paganini : \n\n[email\xa0protected]\n\n#### QUICK LINKS\n\n- Home\n- Cyber Crime\n- Cyber warfare\n- APT\n- Data Breach\n- Deep Web\n- Digital ID\n- Hacking\n- Hacktivism\n- Intelligence\n- Internet of Things\n- Laws and regulations\n- Malware\n- Mobile\n- Reports\n- Security\n- Social Networks\n- Terrorism\n- ICS-SCADA\n- POLICIES\n- Contact me\n\nCopyright@securityaffairs 2024\n\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

According to 11 media buyers who spoke to Digiday, its pitch to decision-makers emphasizes a refreshed user interface, CTV inventory, and, in select cases, financial incentives. Along the way, it hopes to expand its advertiser base to include more non-endemics.\n\nWhile it’s far from winning over the industry, it’s gained media buyers’ attention — and likely that of market incumbents The Trade Desk and Google’s DV360.\n\n## Amazon’s offer to buyers\n\nOne agency buyer, who asked to remain anonymous, told Digiday the platform’s reps had made an unusual offer: for video investments made on behalf of new advertisers, including spend on Prime Video, the platform would offer an additional 10% worth of the client’s buy, up to a ceiling of $250,000. They told Digiday the offer was part of a broader pitch “pushing” Amazon DSP’s upper-funnel capabilities.\n\nAccording to another anonymous media buyer, Amazon had reduced its usual “tech fees,” charges applied by a DSP when an agency uses its tech, in the last six months to induce agencies to spend more on its platform. The company showed “a healthy appetite to lower tech fees,” the buyer said. In this agency’s case, the fees had been cut to 10%.\n\nThough rates differ among DSPs depending on the media agency involved (another media buyer told Digiday such fees could range anywhere between 3% and 15%), it’s a sign that, using the same loss-leader logic supermarkets apply to milk and bread, Amazon is content to slice its own margins if it persuades buyers and brands to entrust more ad spend with them.\n\n“If you were going to make a decision between an individual DSP … Amazon eating some of the costs or fees or taxes would be a factor that would be relevant,” said Harry Inglis, head of activation at Media by Mother.\n\nAccording to The Information, Amazon has also offered discounts to clients using Amazon Web Services to tempt them to spend more on ads.\n\nAn Amazon Ads spokesperson told Digiday in an email: “Amazon DSP helps advertisers reach an average ad-supported audience of more than 275 million in the U.S. alone.\xa0We’re focused on making Amazon DSP the best place to buy advertising through our continued innovation to increase efficiency and lower campaign management costs, while delivering outsized performance.\n\n“By combining our trillions of purchasing, streaming and buying signals, diverse ad-supported properties, and advanced technology, we’re able to create meaningful connections between brands and customers that drive measurable business results at scale.”\n\n## Account services and UX upgrades\n\nAmazon’s pitch has a human component, too. According to Leah Lam, associate director of brand media at indie media agency Collective Measures, staffers for the company had reached out to invite the agency to shift spend from non-endemic clients its way in recent weeks. Amazon had so many sales staff that the agency now had access to four reps within the company. “They are really going at it,” Lam said.\n\nIn fact, Amazon reps have been pitching hard to bring more “non-endemic” advertisers under its umbrella, hyping up Prime Video, Twitch, and Amazon’s first-party data offer — which is built on its market-leading commerce platform — as well as ads it doesn’t own.\n\n“Amazon really would like us to be using them more on open web inventory,” said Matt Wilke, head of programmatic at Mediaplus U.K.\n\nIt also overhauled the user interface for its DSP in January, salving a longtime sore point for buyers who complained that its unintuitive design made it more trouble than it was worth. According to Noble People head of product John Gladysz, those improvements made it easier for smaller agencies to recommend the DSP to clients.\n\n“They’ve been generally improving operationally. I think they still have some space to go,” added John Thankamony, managing director of addressable media and total commerce at Dentsu U.K.\n\n## Amazon’s core priorities\n\nEach of these elements serves Amazon’s broader strategy: attracting new brands, increasing existing clients’ spending, and attracting as many small business advertisers as possible.\n\nThe company’s loss-leader tactics in the DSP market (which echo its success in driving down streaming CPMs) mark it out as the most aggressive of the big three DSP providers, but it’s not the only one making moves.\n\nThe Trade Desk is currently the “workhorse” DSP for many clients, said Inglis. Its headstart in the CTV space – it’s the gateway to Netflix and Disney+ for many advertisers, a status it’s building on by developing a CTV operating system – is “one of their big unique selling points,” Inglis said.\n\nThe company has also been emphasizing the quality of audience targeting data available via its partnerships with retail media networks, according to Dominic Johnson, associate director of brand media at Collective Measures, who cited sales materials sent to his agency.\n\nBy contrast, buyers told Digiday they’d had little communication from Google. Johnson said, “I don’t think we’ve ever heard from anyone at Google saying, ‘Hey, do you want to talk about our DSP?’”\n\n## What media buyers really care about\n\nMost media agencies use two or three DSPs for their programmatic buying, assigning one as a “primary” and others “secondary” status, explained Ryan Eusanio, svp, video and programmatic at Omnicom Media Group. Though buyers might have their favorites, they’ll typically choose a DSP based on how their innate capabilities, like DV360’s access to YouTube, The Trade Desk’s depth of CTV inventory, or Amazon’s commerce data, match a client’s needs.\n\nBuyers also consider the inventory on offer, the quality and depth of targeting options, pricing, and customer service. “You see a big difference across partners in terms of how they lean in,” said Delia Marshall, president of Eicoff, a performance agency that’s part of WPP’s Ogilvy network.\n\nRelated Insights\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAll of which means that if Amazon wants to carve out more of the advertising market for itself, it’ll need to go through media buyers.\n\nIt’s a fortunate time to make a move. Google is currently awaiting a historic legal judgment that could bisect its business, while grumbles about The Trade Desk from holdco media experts have become louder since the ad tech firm’s recent earnings miss.\n\nMeanwhile, advertisers are scrutinizing every part of their budgets amid an uncertain economic environment, including costs associated with ad tech. “They’re paying more attention than they used to,” said Gartner analyst Eric Schmitt.\n\n“Amazon, a few years ago, was a performance DSP,” said Jonathan D’Souza-Rauto, biddable product lead at agency Kepler. Its efforts to invite more brand dollars, however, are paying off. Two in three U.S. advertisers now use Amazon’s DSP, and usage rose 18% between March 2024 and September 2024, according to a survey by Advertiser Perceptions.\n\nThe firm still faces challenges convincing buyers to abandon The Trade Desk and Google. For one, Amazon’s utility for advertisers that don’t sell through its e-commerce mart or want to run broad brand-building campaigns isn’t settled.\n\nForrester analyst Nikhil Lai said the company’s executives aim to prove it can “credibly” help advertisers in either of those camps. “Everything they’re doing is in service of moving upstream and trying to capture more brand dollars and activating non-endemic demand,” he said.\n\nThe Trade Desk did not respond to requests for comment by time of publication.\n\n- Facebook\n- Twitter\n- LinkedIn\n- Reddit\n\nhttps://digiday.com/?p=573808\n\nTrending in The Programmatic Marketer\n\n- 01\n\nThe Programmatic Marketer \n\t\t\t\tThe Trade Desk stumbles, and the ad tech world cheers — maybe too soon\n- 02\n\nThe Programmatic Marketer \n\t\t\t\tOmnicom Media Group maps its own path to avoid the potholes of programmatic\n- Sponsored \n\t\t\t\tHow data marketplaces are evolving to meet buyers’ expectations\n- 03\n\nSponsored \n\t\t\t\tThe state of ad serving for brands and agencies: Revenue growth, channel strategies and the rise of AI\n\nMost Read\n\n- 01\n\nMarketing on Platforms \n\t\t\t\tMeta moves into controversial ad space: principal-based trading\n- 02\n\nAgency Culture \n\t\t\t\tAgencies call foul as Google reps play hardball with AI pitches to clients\n- 03\n\nRetail Revolution \n\t\t\t\t‘We’ve got to call their bluff’: Amidst retail media spend scrutiny, advertisers pull out of negotiations\n- 04\n\nThe Creator Economy \n\t\t\t\tSome B2B marketers are banking on their own employees to create content for their brands\n- 05\n\nGenerative AI \n\t\t\t\tAdvertisers are starting to walk away from platforms’ AI solutions that once promised them everything\n\n### More in Media Buying\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#### Why big advertisers are buying Brave’s search ads — despite its small size\n\n- Facebook\n- Twitter\n- LinkedIn\n- Reddit\n\nBrave is pitching a high-intent alternative to Google that bypasses traditional tracking and attribution.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#### Bold Call: The ad industry’s herd mentality risks an unnecessarily severe slowdown\n\n- Facebook\n- Twitter\n- LinkedIn\n- Reddit\n\nIt’s not the economy, it’s the anxiety.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#### Media Buying Briefing: Auto marketers aren’t slowing ad spend in face of tariff tension\n\n- Facebook\n- Twitter\n- LinkedIn\n- Reddit\n\nMarketers at Honda’s Acura brand are pressing ahead with a spring SUV launch campaign, despite threat from tariff uncertainty.

Our Delta Facility is fully operational and has annual production capacity of 11,000 kg. We are continuously evaluating ways to improve both our yield and quality at the Delta Facility and are in the trial stage of evaluating additional lighting at site.\n\nIn order to increase our supply of premium flower, we plan to acquire the Hope Facility that will significantly expand our annual production capacity, adding an annual production capacity of 4,500 kg, representing an over 40% increase over our current annual production capacity from the Delta Facility, bringing total annual production capacity to 15,500 kg of premium cannabis. This acquisition is planned to close in Q2 2025 with certain incremental capital to meet our requirements completed by mid-summer. Pending licensing timing expected sometime in the summer, we expect to be running at full capacity by the end of the year but not contributing to our revenue until 2026. We expect to incur additional debt financing related to the Hope Facility.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nOur 2024 net revenue growth has been driven through strategic partnerships with co-manufacturers and contract growers and these arrangements are expected to provide up to 2,000 kgs of incremental biomass to our business in 2025. We plan to continue to collaborate with our trusted partners and explore additional partnerships as we strive to meet the growing demand for our high-quality premium products.\n\nBuilding Trust with our Customers in Canada\n\nWe are committed to the growing Canadian cannabis market and dedicated to being a trusted partner for our customers—including provincial distributors, retailers, and consumers. As the Canadian customers face increasing competition from international demand, we have seen many mainstream and premium licensed producers shifting their sales abroad. We see this as a prime opportunity to strengthen our brand presence in Canada.\n\nWith SKU rationalization underway across several provinces, suppliers are being evaluated on reliability and sales performance. This shift is raising the bar for market entry, making it increasingly challenging for new brands and products to secure shelf space. At the same time, Canadian consumers are becoming more brand-loyal, prioritizing trust and value in their purchasing decisions. We believe our award-winning brands and diverse product portfolio will continue to resonate with them.\n\nAdvertisement 7\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nLooking ahead, we anticipate a more competitive retail landscape. However, Rubicon’s strong brand recognition, consumer loyalty, high supplier ratings, and strategic positioning provide a solid foundation for long-term success in Canada.\n\nGenetics\n\nWe possess valuable and unique intellectual property in cannabis genetics, which we consider a critical asset in maintaining our position as a leading innovator within the industry. Our extensive genetics library is central to our strategy of delivering consistent, high-quality genetics and new product offerings for the premium and super-premium markets. While we maintain confidentiality around our specific genetics strategy, we view this as a significant competitive advantage and anticipate introducing exciting new genetic launches in 2025.\n\nInternational\n\nOur strong reputation in Canada has attracted an increasing number of inquiries from international medical cannabis buyers. The international cannabis market has experienced significant growth in recent years, with continued expansion anticipated. While the market is still in the early stages of adopting premium cannabis products, we aim to meet small amounts of the international demand with a test and learn strategy in 2025 making sure to meet our Canadian customer needs as a priority. The Company holds the necessary certifications for international exports and made its inaugural international shipment in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nAdvertisement 8\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nFinancial Growth\n\nFor 2025, we are forecasting growth in both net revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, excluding acquisition-related and start up operational costs associated with the Hope Facility (the “Hope Costs”), driven by our ongoing expansion and strategic initiatives. While we anticipate strong performance in 2025, we expect the Hope Costs will impact our overall financial results. Despite the potential short-term impact of the Hope Costs on profitability, we are confident that our continued growth in net revenue and improved like-for-like Adjusted EBITDA will position us for long-term success and value creation.\n\nConference Call\n\nThe Company will be hosting a conference call to discuss Q4 2024 results on Wednesday, April 2, 2025.

The Company plans to use the Hope Facility to expand its production capacity. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2025.\n- The Company’s Delta Facility received its CUMCS Equivalency IMC-G.A.P. certification and executed its first international shipment.\n- 1964 Supply Co™ launched two more FSE resin vapes with LA Kush and Stinky Pinky, bringing the total amount of vapes available to 7.\n\n2025 Outlook\n\nSecuring Additional Premium Quality Supply\n\nWith growing demand for Canadian cannabis from the domestic and international markets, we see that controlling access to premium quality supply is critical to continue to grow our brands and gross revenue. Our Delta Facility is fully operational and has annual production capacity of 11,000 kg. We are continuously evaluating ways to improve both our yield and quality at the Delta Facility and are in the trial stage of evaluating additional lighting at site.\n\nIn order to increase our supply of premium flower, we plan to acquire the Hope Facility that will significantly expand our annual production capacity, adding an annual production capacity of 4,500 kg, representing an over 40% increase over our current annual production capacity from the Delta Facility, bringing total annual production capacity to 15,500 kg of premium cannabis. This acquisition is planned to close in Q2 2025 with certain incremental capital to meet our requirements completed by mid-summer. Pending licensing timing expected sometime in the summer, we expect to be running at full capacity by the end of the year but not contributing to our revenue until 2026. We expect to incur additional debt financing related to the Hope Facility.\n\nOur 2024 net revenue growth has been driven through strategic partnerships with co-manufacturers and contract growers and these arrangements are expected to provide up to 2,000 kgs of incremental biomass to our business in 2025. We plan to continue to collaborate with our trusted partners and explore additional partnerships as we strive to meet the growing demand for our high-quality premium products.\n\nBuilding Trust with our Customers in Canada\n\nWe are committed to the growing Canadian cannabis market and dedicated to being a trusted partner for our customers—including provincial distributors, retailers, and consumers. As the Canadian customers face increasing competition from international demand, we have seen many mainstream and premium licensed producers shifting their sales abroad. We see this as a prime opportunity to strengthen our brand presence in Canada.\n\nWith SKU rationalization underway across several provinces, suppliers are being evaluated on reliability and sales performance. This shift is raising the bar for market entry, making it increasingly challenging for new brands and products to secure shelf space. At the same time, Canadian consumers are becoming more brand-loyal, prioritizing trust and value in their purchasing decisions. We believe our award-winning brands and diverse product portfolio will continue to resonate with them.\n\nLooking ahead, we anticipate a more competitive retail landscape. However, Rubicon’s strong brand recognition, consumer loyalty, high supplier ratings, and strategic positioning provide a solid foundation for long-term success in Canada.\n\nGenetics\n\nWe possess valuable and unique intellectual property in cannabis genetics, which we consider a critical asset in maintaining our position as a leading innovator within the industry. Our extensive genetics library is central to our strategy of delivering consistent, high-quality genetics and new product offerings for the premium and super-premium markets. While we maintain confidentiality around our specific genetics strategy, we view this as a significant competitive advantage and anticipate introducing exciting new genetic launches in 2025.\n\nInternational\n\nOur strong reputation in Canada has attracted an increasing number of inquiries from international medical cannabis buyers. The international cannabis market has experienced significant growth in recent years, with continued expansion anticipated. While the market is still in the early stages of adopting premium cannabis products, we aim to meet small amounts of the international demand with a test and learn strategy in 2025 making sure to meet our Canadian customer needs as a priority. The Company holds the necessary certifications for international exports and made its inaugural international shipment in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nFinancial Growth\n\nFor 2025, we are forecasting growth in both net revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, excluding acquisition-related and start up operational costs associated with the Hope Facility (the “Hope Costs”), driven by our ongoing expansion and strategic initiatives. While we anticipate strong performance in 2025, we expect the Hope Costs will impact our overall financial results. Despite the potential short-term impact of the Hope Costs on profitability, we are confident that our continued growth in net revenue and improved like-for-like Adjusted EBITDA will position us for long-term success and value creation.\n\nConference Call\n\nThe Company will be hosting a conference call to discuss Q4 2024 results on Wednesday, April 2, 2025.
